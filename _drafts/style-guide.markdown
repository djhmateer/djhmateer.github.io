I started blogging about 8 years ago with [programgood.net](http://www.programgood.net)  It turned into a very good ideas repository, not a blog.  *That's fine.*  
 
I'd now like to try a more 'walkthrough' style blog, taking inspiration from [hanselman.com](http://www.hanselman.com) and [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5) 

Like all research projects, I start with [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/), so I can share notes across all devices (2 at home, 1 at work and iPhone)

## Why Blog?
* Help others 
* Build my brand as a developer so I can earn money to feed my family
* Carrot to 'finish' writing projects

## Titles
What is in it for the reader?

## Who are the target audience?

Jeff Bezos - write the press release first.
