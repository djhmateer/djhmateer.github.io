Refactoring towards testable code and happier developers - [https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8181-lscc-talks-may](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8181-lscc-talks-may)

20min video of the talk on code quality

Having well maintained code makes it easier to find bugs, add features, bring new developers onto a team, solve performance issues and makes developers happy!

David will take you through a practical guide on how to do this with your codebase.

He will start at the beginning then get more detailed covering: formatting, commenting, zombie code, naming, refactoring tools, method lengths, commands/queries, complexity, conditional logic, composition/inheritance, duplication and responsibility.

30,000,000+ songs! Explore your favourite music with Spotify's JSON Web API, MVC5, Dapper and OAuth2 [https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6350-30m-plus-songs-explore-your-favorite-music-with-spotifys-json-web-api-mvc5-dapper-and-oauth2](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6350-30m-plus-songs-explore-your-favorite-music-with-spotifys-json-web-api-mvc5-dapper-and-oauth2)

Challenge: "While coding at work I want to listen to great songs and albums that I know" - This live MVC5 site shows the most influential, seminal albums and great songs of different musical era's. Explore the lists, preview songs (without a Spotify account). Select what you like, then save this playlist to your Spotify account.

I will start from basics and move quickly - how to explore a JSON API with .NET using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

- Find Artists, Songs, Playlists and Users
- Display great images and Artist Wikipedia articles
- Create and follow playlists
- Learn about OAuth2 - its seems complicated from the outside… I'll show you how to do it.

Use MVC5 simply and close to the metal with Dapper as a high performance ORM.

This is going to be a pragmatic (source on Github), entertaining, musically inspiring, fast paced talk… Enjoy!
