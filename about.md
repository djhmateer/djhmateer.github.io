Dave lives near Brighton in England and by day he works on large financial internal systems in ASP.NET and MSSQL. Dave gets up at 0500 most days to work on side projects because he loves to code ~~entertain his son who still gets up crazy early :-)~~ He started sleeping after 18 months!

 He then plays with his ~~5 month old~~ ~~2 year~~ ~~3.5~~ 4.5 year old daughter and ~~3 month~~ ~~nearly 2~~ 2.5 year old son, usually listening to ABBA. Then ~~mountain bikes~~ takes the train to work dreaming of music and code…

## 2019
Dave is speaking on Functional programming in C# including [Functional Brighton](https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Brighton/events/260140369/) where he will demo a Broken link checker written functionally. [This is an example of a link which it should pickup!](https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Brighton/events/260140369/asdf)

[Refactoring towards testable code and happier developers](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8181-lscc-talks-may)

20min video of the talk on code quality

Having well maintained code makes it easier to find bugs, add features, bring new developers onto a team, solve performance issues and makes developers happy!

David will take you through a practical guide on how to do this with your codebase.

He will start at the beginning then get more detailed covering: formatting, commenting, zombie code, naming, refactoring tools, method lengths, commands/queries, complexity, conditional logic, composition/inheritance, duplication and responsibility.

[30,000,000+ songs! Explore your favourite music with Spotify's JSON Web API, MVC5, Dapper and OAuth2](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6350-30m-plus-songs-explore-your-favorite-music-with-spotifys-json-web-api-mvc5-dapper-and-oauth2)

Challenge: "While coding at work I want to listen to great songs and albums that I know" - This live MVC5 site shows the most influential, seminal albums and great songs of different musical era's. Explore the lists, preview songs (without a Spotify account). Select what you like, then save this playlist to your Spotify account.

I will start from basics and move quickly - how to explore a JSON API with .NET using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

Find Artists, Songs, Playlists and Users
Display great images and Artist Wikipedia articles
Create and follow playlists
Learn about OAuth2 - its seems complicated from the outside… I'll show you how to do it.

Use MVC5 simply and close to the metal with Dapper as a high performance ORM.

This is going to be a pragmatic (source on Github), entertaining, musically inspiring, fast paced talk… Enjoy!
