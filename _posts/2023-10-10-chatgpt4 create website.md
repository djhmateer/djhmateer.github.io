In my series of exploration of LLM's / GPT, lets see if it can help me create a website for a new business.

This is really part 1, 2 and 3 here. 

1. Coding / code completion / summerisation of code - html / css
2. Assimilating information and summerising  - coming up with project plan
3. Generation (text / image) - generating content / images
4. Coversation (chatbots)
5. Knowledge accessibility - question and answer 


## 1.1 Starting from a blank slate

This to me seems like a great use case for programmers/entrepreneurs who just want to get started quickly to rapidly iterate on a project.

## Idea and Why

Lets imagine that I want to explore the idea of 

> running home brew training courses in real life

Why: 

- Becuase it is something I want to go on.
- Becuase it is a complicated hobby to get started with and there is always something more to learn
- Seeing others do something is a great way to learn
- You'll come away with wort to ferment of the different beers we will make
- Get away for a holiday / adventure
- Get the right kit a the right price
- Find top tips on suppliers of ingredients 
- Our favourite recipes 
- Will visit a commercial brewery
- Will visit home setups in the kitchen, outside and custom brew shed.

### Caveat.. and why not

*caveat - I'm not sure this is a good idea at all, but as an example, why not. And actually this is what LLM's are all about.. is moving fast, failing fast, so lets push this example and see what happens.*
