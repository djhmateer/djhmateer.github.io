I've got a need to make some websites look more professional.

## Why

- Marketing
- Don't Make me Think - make it easy for people to understand
- Help users get the most out of the tool

## How

- Review 40 of the most relevant / successful sites in that area
- Look for commonalities
- Review VS Code and Emmet (I'll start as simple as possible)
- Review tecnology on CSS / Flexbox / CSS Grid
- Do I need helper libraries eg Bootstrap / 

## What Sites

The websites I need to implement on are:

- osr4rights - a 'commercial' tools site
- davemateer.com - technical blog
- hmsoftware.co.uk - consulting SaaS? Training SaaS
- Marketing and Operations dashboard product - SaaS product
- Broken Link Checker - SaaS product

The technologies behind these sites I've got full control over, so no problem to use whatever technologies I like.

I'm generally targetting evergreen browsers.

## 40 Sites Results

My goals for these sites are to provide

- Simplicity ie in the style of Don't Make Me Think, make sure users are not surprised 
- Professionalism
- Trust

### Top

- Top right is always Log In, or Register (a Call to Action - CTA), or Call Us
- Top left is a logo
- Top is a menu... clickable???
- Top bar - news eg We are presenting at ___ Rights con.

### Middle

- Middle is a big heading saying what it is eg 
- Middle image - often a smiling person..
- Under middle is a sub heading 
- Under sub heading are more buttons - CTA eg Sign Up (no credit card required). Or Enter your email.
- Language: Free, Trust, Viuew live demo,


- Under that is: trusted by (and logos of companies)
- Often numbers eg 30m users, $1bn revenue.., 5* rating product hunt

### Footer

- Footer contains lot of links to other userful articles
- Footer contains privacy


## HTML / CSS

- Use HTML5 Semantic tags to help eg header, main, section, footer
- CSS Grid - overall layout
- Flexbox - inner elements
- Aim for no CSS frameworks
- Aim for minimal JS
