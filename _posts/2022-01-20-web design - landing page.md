I've got a need to make some websites look more professional.

Don't Make me Think

## Why

- Marketing
- Don't Make me Think - make it easy for people to understand
- Help users get the most out of the tool


## How

- Review 40 of the most relevant / successful sites in that area
- Look for commonalities

- osr4rights - a 'commercial' tools site
- davemateer.com - technical blog
- hmsoftware.co.uk - consulting company

## Results

- Top right is always Log In, or Register (a Call to Action - CTA), or Call Us
- Top left is a logo
- Top is a menu... clickable???
- Top bar - news eg We are presenting at ___ Rights con.

- Middle is a big heading saying what it is eg 
- Middle image - often a smiling person..
- Under middle is a sub heading 
- Under sub heading are more buttons - CTA eg Sign Up (no credit card required). Or Enter your email.
- Language: Free, Trust, Viuew live demo,


- Under that is: trusted by (and logos of companies)
- Often numbers eg 30m users, $1bn revenue.., 5* rating product hunt

- Footer contains lot of links to other userful articles
- Footer contains privacy
