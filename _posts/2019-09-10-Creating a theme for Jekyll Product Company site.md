I'm mostly a back end developer and entrepreneur. Hosting a high performance site with Jekyll on GitHub Pages, content editing in markdown is all something I'm comfortable with. CSS, Javascript and design are things I kmow less well. So here is are my resources for front end for:

- Company website eg BrightSoft
- Product website eg Broken Link Checker
- Charity website eg Rewilding Sussex
- Personal blog eg davemateer.com, mateer.dev, peter [animateddata.com](https://www.animateddata.com/)

## Who is the target audience

Developers?  
Is it easy to understand?  

What is the call to action
