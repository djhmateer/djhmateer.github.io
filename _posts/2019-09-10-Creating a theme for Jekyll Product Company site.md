I'm developer and entrepreneur working on C# and MSSQL.  

CSS, Javascript and design are things I know less well! I have a need for:

- Charity website eg Rewilding Sussex
- Product website eg Broken Link Checker
- My new company website eg BrightSoft
- Advice on my wife's [hoverflylagoons.co.uk](https://hoverflylagoons.co.uk) Wordpress site
- Update personal blogs eg davemateer.com, mateer.dev, peter [animateddata.com](https://www.animateddata.com/)

So it became time to look into the front end again. For [commercial projects I like to use boring technology](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20985875) like this link and others on hacker news.

## HTML Template for single (long) page site

Static site generators like Jekyll are templating engines predominantly. If you have a single static long page then maybe you don't need it and can use raw html and css.  

[Here is a demo Bootstrap4 nonprofit theme](http://themes.semicolonweb.com/html/canvas/demo-nonprofit.html) which may be a good enough start for my charity website.  

Here are my go to sites for templates:

- [Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates)
- [UICookies.com](https://uicookies.com/) 
- [ThemeHunt](https://themehunt.com/items/html/corporate-business/latest)
- [HTML5up.net](https://html5up.net)

The latest style of sites (Bootstrap4 et al.) is to design for mobile first, so longer pages that are easily swipeable are what is happening.

If the site is multi page, or will require a build pipeline I generally go to Jekyll:

Hosting, domain names, SEO, sitemaps, image optinmisation, search are covered elsewhere on my blog.

## Who is the website for

To help guide development we need to ask, who is our customer ie who is the website for?

For a charity it could be:

- Be impressive (maybe boss/money giving body?)  
- Find more information (maybe they are journalists needing to write an article)  
- Links to research (maybe they are students?)
- Sign up to follow you on Twitter (everyone?)
- Sign up for a newsletter (maybe they are interested general public)
- Donate money?

For a products website it could be:

- Try the product quickly (potential customer)
- Understand what the product does in 3 seconds (potential customer)
- Find support (existing customer)
- Sign up for a newsletter for when it releases (potential customer)
- Tips on how to use the prouduct (existing customer)

## HTML Template with Jekyll for multi pages sites

[ExperimentingWithCode](https://experimentingwithcode.com/using-a-bootstrap-theme-with-jekyll/) has a good tutorial on splitting up the [Business Casual Bootstrap4 html tempate](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/business-casual/) and using Jekyll.  

[My implementation of his code](https://github.com/djhmateer/dm-startbootstrap-business-casual) which is more towards that current default of [putting scss partials into /_sass](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/)

{% highlight html %}
{% raw  %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  {% include head.html %}
  <body>
    {% include banner.html %}
    {% include navbar.html %}
    {{ content }}
    {% include footer.html %}
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

then the generated css is linked:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap core CSS -->
    <link href="vendor/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- Custom fonts for this template -->
    <link
        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:100,100i,200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i,900,900i"
        rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:400,400i,700,700i" rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- Custom styles for this template -->
    <link href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```

This will be minified by the Jekyll Sass build pipeline

## Sass / SCSS

From the [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5654447/whats-the-difference-between-scss-and-sass):

[Sass-lang](https://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS pre-processor. Style sheets are processed, and turned into regular CSS style sheets. There are 2 syntaxes available for Saas:

- .scss - Sassy CSS. Every CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file. Boostrap4 is built on this.
- .saas - older. Uses indentation rather than brackets

Sass allows for variables in CSS.

## Jekyll Sass

[Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/#sassscss)

```liquid
---
# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
---

@import "business-casual";
```

business-casual.scss is in the default _sass folder.

/css/main.scss is transformed into /css/main.css which currently isn't minified (but is tiny 1.1k in our case.) Bootstrap4 minified is 23.4k

## Form submit and email
