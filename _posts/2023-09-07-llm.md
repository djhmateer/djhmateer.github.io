- learning, problem-solving, resoning, understanding natural language

## Background

1966 ELIZA language model debued at MIT

All language models are:

- trained on a set of data
- infer relationships and generate new content based on the trained data

## Terminology

AI - [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) 

LLM - Large Language Model is a type of AI algorithm

NLP - Natural Language Processing applications. Where a user inputs a query in (English) to generate a result.

Deep Learning - 

Transformer architecture - standard architecture for language modeling since 2018. Developed by Google.

## Chatbots

Chatbot - mimics human conversation. modern ones use AI

ChatGPT - Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer. LLM based chatbot. Released Nov 2022

Microsoft Bing Chat - uses GPT-4

Google Bard -
