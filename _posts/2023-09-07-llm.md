**rough notes on AI that I'm adding to all the time**

What is AI?

- Simulation of human intelligence in machines.
- ability of machines to perform tasks that.. associated with humans.. 
- learning, problem-solving, resoning, understanding natural language

## Background

1966 ELIZA language model debued at MIT

All language models are:

- trained on a set of data
- infer relationships and generate new content based on the trained data

## Terminology

AI - [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) 

LLM - Large Language Model is a type of AI algorithm

NLP - Natural Language Processing applications. Where a user inputs a query in (English) to generate a result.

Deep Learning - 

Transformer architecture - standard architecture for language modeling since 2018. Developed by Google.

# What is a Language Model

[https://vimeo.com/863153253](https://vimeo.com/863153253)

A mathematical model of human language... which allows it to mimic human language... which is why it can generate text that looks like an intelligent person


A couple of years ago OpenAI and Google started training these models with huge amounts of words from. 

### Step 1 - get text

GPT-3 training data:

- common crawl (60%)
- webtext2 (22%)
- books (15%)
- whole of wikipedia (3%)

97% English language

representative of last 30 years of English speaking culture

### Step 2 - feed into neural network

Learned about the structure of the text and made a mathematical model

Captured structure of language ie relationships between words and sentences and how they are arranged. Also captured all the content of those words

Captured cultual, historical knowledge, scientific knowledge, legal. 

Essentiallly a fuzzy cultural map of all human knowledge in the last 30 yeras of decades in English

> we've invented something but we don't know what it is capable of


### research

in education research - if you train it on a paper, then can ask quesions

- summerise
- key points
- answer questions on the text
- explain like I'm 5

### creative writing

- writers.... more cat like... more dog like.
- song lyrics


## timeline

- GPT-3 - May 2020
- GH Co-pilot - June 2021
- ChatGPT release - Nov 2022... explosive hype starts!
- GPT-4 - March 2023



# Elicit

speeds up literature review for professional researchers


## questions

Hallucinating! It's just making predictions based on training data.. not connected to the real world.

- "what is the world record for crossing the english channel entirely on foot?" - this answer changes all the time. Chat GPT-3.5

- where are the n's in mayonnaise?  GPT-3.5  answer: The word "mayonnaise" does not contain the letter "n." It is spelled M-A-Y-O-N-N-A-I-S-E. So, there are no "n's" in the word "mayonnaise."

## Black box

We can't tell why it tells us a certain answer! ie it's like we've built a car but can't explain why the wheels go around.

- more like a biological creature we've grown rather than tool we've invented
- learns by trial and error
- emergent, surprising behaviour we need to study

AI researchers and ML scientists - LLMs as 'Alien Minds'.

## Chatbots

Chatbot - mimics human conversation. modern ones use AI

ChatGPT - Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer. LLM based chatbot. Released Nov 2022. 2,000 characters input

[Microsoft Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/) - uses GPT-4... 4,000 characters input

[Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/)

## Open Source Chatbots

[LLaMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA) - Large Language Model Meta AI. Feb 2023

LLaMA-2 - July 2023. 7, 13 and 70 billion parameters.

[https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) Open LLM Leaderboard

Falcon - 180B. Sept 2023. 180b parameters Trained on 3.5tn tokens.


## ChatGPT

[chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/) - GPT-3.5 is free. GPT-4.0 is paid.

The API is different pricing to ChatGPT PLus ($20 per month)

## Bing Chat

[https://www.bing.com/new](https://www.bing.com/new) - uses GPT-4 under the hood along with Bing.

There is a sidebar for Edge, where you get more time..


## Uses of Chatbots

### Anyone

- check spelling, grammer and tone of this email

- summerise this text: (eg scientific article)

- write poem on happiness that is easy to understand

- write a 200 word essay on ....

## Business

- write a job description for a marketing manager

## Coder

- generate code
- explain code

## Image Creators

Create art from words.. or upload an image

[Bing image creator](https://www.bing.com/create) - powered by Dall-E. Seem to get 100 free images.

[Dall-e 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) -  only get a few free credits.
