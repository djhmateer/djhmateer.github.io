I was exploring iMovie which was good, but ultimately my hardware was too old and frustrating to simple editing on ie chop up clips quickly, which is a super important part of getting good at making movies.

So lets move fast and onto Premiere Pro

## Install Proces and Cost

There is a 7 day free trial of Adobe Premiere Pro. £19.97/mo (annual but paid montly), £30.34/mo cancel anytime.

Adobe Genuine Service (AGS) - didn't need to install

Creative Cloud Desktop, which installs Premiere Pro.

took about 15mins. Tutorial didn't start and seemed to hang (worked after a restart of the program). I couldn't figure out the `next` button, so went straight to youtube for guidance on how to use it.


## Nomenclature

- Project Panel - import and organise media
- Source Monitor - review footage
- Timeline - arrange clips into a sequence
- Program monitor - preview


## Create New Project

`c:\premiere` is where I keep my projects

Create Bins


- Broll - shots
- Drone shots
- VFX - overlays?
- Audio

## GoPro footage

- THM file - thumbnail
- LRV file - low resolution video

I like to have correct dates modified when copying to filesystem

```
robocopy H:\DCIM\100GOPRO c:\gopro /COPY:DT /DCOPY:T
```

## Create new Sequence

DSLR 25fps - I found that 29.97 was better for GoPro

Have also found that it is 5312 * 2988

## Workspace
