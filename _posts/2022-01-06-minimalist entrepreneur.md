An entrepreneurial book by the founder of gumroad and a good speaker.

Summary - lots of good advice and common sense

Background - I'm becoming a student of business, and am enjoying seeing the commonaliites that everyone talks about.

I'm back in the initial stages of launching a product after some forays which fortuntaly I've backed out of before they consumed too much. It is a fascinating, stressful,.... path. Like learning how to program for the first time and thinking you'll never understand anything, and you're doomed. 

[How to find a problem worth solving]() is my blog post on this first stage of entrepreneurism.


Like programming there are many people telling you what you *should* be doing. For example Design Patterns in programming always were an anathema for me, and felt like soemthing to strive towards. I've learned on the Journey (to hopefully Master) that no, they need not be something to strive towards. It is only by doing and understanding that we know this. I wish I'd read some *good* code earlier in my career that steered me in that general direction. It really is annoying the MS promote some complex code when simplicity is really the key.

So, how can simplicity be tranferred into the business realm?

A problem I've been struggling with is what problem to solve?

I'm a software person, so I can build SaaS products, and love being a builder!

## Profitability First

Being in a good Market

[brokenlinkchecker.org](https://brokenlinkchecker.org) is a technical exploration project of mine where I thought there may be a market.

As a 'cash machine' I think it will ultimately not be what I want 

eg 

- B2B
- 100 customers paying $100pm


What is the product I want to sell to a customer?

## Community

I like this advice. Essentially we are starting with the customer first. and finding the right customers

### If I talk, who listens

- programmers - .NET, Wordpress hosting, Jekyll blog
- infrastructure people
- linux people
- windows desktop (and WSL2 people)
- vim people
- bloggers

- people needing tech advice
- business owners eg Carey who need tec guidance
- academic PI's eg Yvonne who need built

### Where and with whom do I already spend my time, online and offline

- Kingston running group
- cask beer society
- lewes home brew club
- DH and MH haning out for beers and food
- Academics
- Human Rights Invetigators
- Musicians
- Friends drinking beer and going to breweries
- ex Raleigh expedition
- 

### In what situations am I most authentically myself

- programmers
- outdoors people - climbers / mountaineers
- parents of young kids
- nct gang
- family

### Who do I hang out with, even though I don't really like them, but it's worth it since we share something more important in common

- parents at school
- home brew club (some people don't listen well)


Turn this list of *communities* into a list of online and offline locations, in which to spend more time learning and contributing

- Facebook group
- Reddit community
- Twitter hashtag
- Instagram hashtag
- Hackernews
- Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange

Notable teachers in each area (mindful of costs)

In person 

- meetups
- workshops
- classes
- speaker series
- networking events

### Contribute, Create, and Teach

1% rule

Once you start contributing people will start to recognise you.

- Work in public
- Teach everything you know
- Create every day

From here you'ldd start to see problems which need solving.

### Picking the community
