I've got a 

- working app
- high performance
- good pipeline to deploy (very fast as well)

## Next App

I've got another application which I need to consider so want this 'side project' exploration to be the same. A perfect test bed.


## JavaScript

However I know that it is brittle as JavaScript - not a great backend language choice

- no compile time safety - typos are runtime errors, refactoring risky..
- degrades at scale
- friction
- ecosystem is constantly changing - node_modules is huge
- complexity creeping in (and hard to control - have a lot of tests.. but still)
- security velnerabilities

## TypeScript

TypeScript solves the type safety problem but not the ecosystem problem. 

This feels like an incremental fix.

## C#

C# is a safe, competent choice. You know it, it's stable, types are good. 

The tradeoff: you'll spend energy resisting enterprise patterns and steering Claude away from OO. If you're okay with that discipline, it works. If you want the language/ecosystem to naturally support simplicity, Go is a better fit

## Go

Simpler language.
Single binary development
fast compile
good std libraries
claude code generates well.
no oo to resist


but

- verbose error handling
- no exceptions
- no map filter reduce
- no immutability
- generics are new 2022
- no ternary

## Does it really matter?

This used to be a gut wrenching decision... but now. perhaps not.

I think in the longer term I'd like to move away from JS/TS purely for compile time safety.

## New Backend - C#

Minimal API
Dapper

So lets just create a new branch and go for it. Actually I've zipped up the directory as well.

## Language and Framework notes

C#

minimal apis
records are immutable
cluade has good knowledge
testing with xunit
vscode

inetersting
 my take was that I want simple, functional..
 it says I'll be fighting OO patterns

it is always pushing me towards Go.
python fastAPI seems common

but I want reliability and safety of a compiled language
 with type safety

I guess with CC it doesn't really matter
 can always


tyep safety (at scale)
refactoring anxiety
 find and replace!
node_modules - dependencies
runtime errors in prod - edge cases



## VSCode

C# Dev Kit
 wants me to sign in for Visual Studio subscription benefits
 I used davemateer@gmail.com to sign in (on microsoft)

 ## DB flow

Route
Service
DB

 Logger - DI..hmm
 Database - Inject...hmm
