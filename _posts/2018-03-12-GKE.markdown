The goal is to get the simplest possible thing working aka hello world

- Setup a 3 node cluster

- [Download gcloud sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads#interactive) which comes with Python 2.7.9

- connect local kubectl console to GKE cluster


## Summary
After experimenting with K8s on the GKE for a few days I found:

- can deploy wordpress to an orchestrated K8s container
- can deploy mysql to an K8s container

if either pods die, then it comes back up.  
as K8s is monitoring then even if both VMs are killed they will both come back

can use persistent storage so  
  mysql data is stored  
  wordpress data is stored  

can load balance (although not set wordpress up as need different type of storage)  

can update really easily  
  - just update the yml file and  
     kubyctl apply -f wordpress.yml  


however, this is complicated, and after killing a few vms, I couldn't see why they didn't come back up.  

Difficult to see logs (lots of different layers)lots of different
