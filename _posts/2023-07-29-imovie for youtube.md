Empathetic to the characters (entertainment)

- no intro music?
- 4 seconds video of what is about to happen ie clip of exciting bit
- talk to camera on what is happening
- intro to team and weather report
- outdoor footage, good music.. roadtrip
- interesting things along the way
- doing the 'recovery'...adventure...not quite sure what will happen or break!

This is good as I picked up on other tips eg increase font size.. but raw content I didn't trust! It was correct, but I went to the [source](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) to double check.

Installing PrivateGPT. Really interesting, but felt like he was teaching us how to clone from GH.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljAWrpmEFoU&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljAWrpmEFoU&t=1s) iMovie 2020 **FULL TUTORIAL**  .. was the first search on imovie beginners guide on YT

`3 Axis Gimble` great as you find out stuff I wasn't expecting!

He filmed all footage on an iPhone with a gimble.

## File Management

iMovie creates a copy and puts it into `iMovie Library` folder which by default is in `\Users\dave\Movies\iMovie Library`  I seem to have 6GB used already in there.

256GB sd card from gopro is formatted as ExFAT - no file size limits, and good for mac

- FAT32 4GB limit (old FS). Mac and Win
- exFAT - no file size. Mac and Win
- NTFS - no file size. read only Mac. 
- APFS - no file size. need paragon software to read/write on windows

## Setting In points and Out points

## Montage style video

put shots along with the music

- m - mark (put on a visual marker) so can get audio to sync to music

## Transitions

jump shots ie not transition are most normal transition
drag between 2 shots - use when something big is happening. eg cymbal crash in music
fade to black between major parts

## photos

ken burns effect - panning / zoom
 imovie preferences

make it small (use rectangle) to decrease size to start and end

## titles

use different fonts to make it look like not imovie

place cursor
q - add conneted media
 
## editing

stabilisation - set to low eg 12%.. well lit

## audio

whilst most people will forgive bad video
most will not forgive bad audio

eg hype mic by apogee sounds just fine

voiceover can do

## base correction

- cmd c
- cmd option v - paste all attributes

## export

- file, share, File
Quality should be `high` and not ``



## Music

 
## imovie

import to project media (rather than global iMovie library)
