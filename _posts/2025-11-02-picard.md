I like listening to albums in my kitchen (which is on the edge of my wifi reception for this old kindle fire). I use a simple mp3 player for it called [musicolet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en_GB) which is lightweight, ad-free, and doesn't require an internet connection.

It's important to me to listen to the albums in the correct order. Over the years I've ripped my CD's onto disk and haven't always got the correct tags / naming / ordering.

Being able to glance at artist and albums.


## Tagging and Ordering

[https://picard.musicbrainz.org/]([https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) - firstly need to View, File Explorer. Then drag a folder onto Unclustered Files. Then Cluster. Then Lookup. If that doesn't work (ie put into final right hand column) then press Scan which will do so.

## Folder and File Name 

As there is a lot of nuance, I'm going to keep copies of everything I do and just try stuff and see what I like

- f:\music - my source
- c:\temp\music  - temp (as it moves folder to destination when done). also useful to have on fast ssd
- f:\music-organised - detination

For my music player, I really like a folder name like:

AC_DC-Back In Black/01 Hells Bells.mp3

```bash
$if2(%artist%,Unknown Artist)-$if2(%album%,Unknown Album)/$if($ne(%tracknumber%,),$num(%tracknumber%,2) ,)$if2(%title%,Unknown Title)
```

Options, File naming Script Editor


## Compilations
