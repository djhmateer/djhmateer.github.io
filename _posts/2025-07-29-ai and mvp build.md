How good is AI at getting to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage?

Lets assume 

- we know who the customers are
- we are solving a problem for them
- they want to 'Give us their money'

So lets build an MVP 

## All in one Vibe coding sites

https://bolt.new/~/stackblitz-starters-zotmtg6q

https://v0.dev

Interesting, but....

## AI's

chatgpt

cursor (Claude?)

## FOO

for a complex webapp:

v0

shadcn/ui uses radixui 
tailwindcss

next - lots of pages... 
(and react).
 these are the 'defaults' of AI

**try different tech stacks with AI

full JS - svelte... next?
full server - .NET, Python, RoR, PHP, Rust?


- Simple
- No ORMs!
- Only a few devs, so can be agile and lean


## MVP of Application

Lets assume it will be a

- well designed
- have a database
- will be a web application


## Cursor Rules




## MVP Single Page Website 

single page website saying what we're doing, to get a launch list of email addresses.

have screenshots of final product (mock ups?)
