I've been running my company HMSoftware for 5 years, which started off as a consulting company (no employees by design and I've kept it that way). I transitioned into a product business with https://auto-archiver.com/  

I've got 2 major clients which pay me monthly / bi-yearly to host and maintain this service. It is open source software, however I've found it takes significant time and technical effort to keep it going well. It also suits my lifestyle as I work at unusual hours (around my young kids schedules). I run servers from my residential premises for technical reasons and enjoy that side of IT.

Like many technical entrepreneurs I enjoy the doing side of the business (working in my business) rather than working on my business - marketing specifically.

So lets explore how AI can help entrepreneurs like me.


## Goals

I would love to get to a MRR of £10k per month



## Chat GPT as a Business Coach


"I run a business https://auto-archiver.com/ which sells a SaaS hosted open source software offering https://github.com/bellingcat/auto-archiver to 2 major clients for a total of £xxxx per month recurring revenue. 

I would like to build this up to £10,000 per month, so need more clients. My clients are https://www.glanlaw.org/ and https://www.info-res.org/  I've also had a client https://www.plurolabs.org/ where we used the archiver to archive youtube clips which showed election officials being targeted in videos, then people making money off these videos, and big corporations sponsoring these videos.

The archiver software is difficult to keep running (requiring consistent monitoring and tweaks). It also needs hosting on virtual machines, preferably behind a fast residential IP network.

The Unique Selling Point of my company is the deep technical expertise in digital archiving.
I've analyzed the competition here: https://davemateer.com/2025/01/13/archiving  And keeping the servers going whilst not getting blocked by platforms.

I have 5 servers running all the time on a 1Gbps downlink and 110Mbps uplink connection. I archive on a typical day between 100 and 1000 unique pages. The most common sites over the last 2 weeks are: instagram, x.com, facebook, twitter, telegram, youtube, aljazeera, wikipedia, actualite.cd, bsky.app (BlueSky)

You are an expert in small business growth / entrepreneurship. Please help me."
