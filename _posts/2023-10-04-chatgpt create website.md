In my series of exploration of LLM's / GPT, lets see if it can help me create a website

This is really part 1 here. 

1. Coding / code completion / summerisation of code
2. Assimilating information and summerising 
3. Generation (text / image)
4. Coversation (chatbots)
5. Knowledge accessibility - question and answer 


## 1.1 Starting from a blank slate

This to me seems like a great use case for programmers who just want to get started quickly! and do things fast


## Idea

So firstly we have to ask why we're doing something.. 

In the video above Charlie is creating educational websites because of the different ways you can monetise them.

- Educational
- Community
- E-Commerce
- Blog

## Name

> create me a name for a belgian home brew beer website based in the uk


## Content

> create an outline of a website for our belgian home brew beer uk website

This is great as it brought up ideas like

- a shop selling belgian beer which I hadn't thought of

This is great for a project proposal too, as it starts to flesh out pages.

> Give me the broad outline for a website for home brew belgian beer in the uk including hero, tagline, call to action button, section for features and details about the beers.

This is an excellent prompt giving some great details.

> please provide content for every one of these that I can copy and paste into the website

This is great content (totally sounds believable)

- Foster a community of people passionate about hoverfly conservation and research.

## 8. Resources and Downloads
