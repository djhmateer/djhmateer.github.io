I'm giving a [feature phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone) a try for

- Running as they are super light and great battery life
- To see if it makes me feel better not being connected - ie work email, internet browsing, weather. I don't do X, Instagram on phone anyway
- As a role model for my kids to get me to stop looking at my phone


Which one to try?

I'm on the Three network in the UK which does not support 2G and like other networks in the UK they are [phasing out 3G](https://www.three.co.uk/support/network-and-coverage/our-plans-to-switch-off-3g). So I need a feature phone that supports 4G calling.

## What is 4G LTE

4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) is entirely IP based. This means all communication including voice is transmitted as data packets.


## Nokia 105 - Feature Phone (returned was sent 2G version)

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09K4CTJMJ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09K4CTJMJ) Nokia 105 4G - was £20 when I bought it.

Date first available 2021

This version should work with 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) which is what the Three network runs on in the UK.

This is what is should have been [https://www.hmd.com/en_int/nokia-105-4g/specs?sku=1GF018TPA1H01](https://www.hmd.com/en_int/nokia-105-4g/specs?sku=1GF018TPA1H01) but it wasn't

I was sent the TA-1416 which is the 2G version 

[![alt text](/assets/2024-06-15/1.jpg "email"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2024-06-15/1.jpg)

I liked the

- simplicity
- torch
- a few games for fun

I didn't like:

- sim card hard to take out (and was not a micro sim so had to use an adapter)
- hard to take flimsy case off the at the back and felt like it might break

## Nokia 110 4G

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nokia-Feature-Bluetooth-Long-Lasting-Pre-loaded/dp/B0C49SH5TC/?th=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nokia-Feature-Bluetooth-Long-Lasting-Pre-loaded/dp/B0C49SH5TC/?th=1)

Have ordered this for £29.95

## Divert Calls to feature phone
asdf

## Vodaphone

Although this seems to be for: smartwatches and tablets to share data allowance
