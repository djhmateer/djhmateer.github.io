I'm giving a [feature phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone) a try for

- Running as they are super light and great battery life
- To see if it makes me feel better not being connected - ie work email, internet browsing, weather. I don't do X, Instagram on phone anyway
- As a role model for my kids to get me to stop looking at my phone

## Update after 2 days

### good points

- Be in the moment as can't 'just check email' or WhatsApp messages
- Not worried about losing/dropping my phone - at £30 it doesn't really matter!
- Not worried about security - all my 2FA etc is not at risk if I lose the phone
- Feeling of freedom, liberation (like the ring in Lord of the Rings) in the house and outside.
- Feel like I've got more time, as not being interrupted
- Nostalgia from when I had a lot of time?
- WhatsApp I use on desktop and laptop at home.. which I prefer anyway.
- Kids don't bug me to play games on my smartphone
- Battery life brilliant (charged fully on Mon 1st July in afternoon... I charged on Friday night and had a few bars left. 4 days)

### bad points

- Sending text message on the feature phone is so slow!
- no wifi calling so terrible signal in my house on Three (will try the other 3 providers)
- Annoying not being able to take notes
- Have to carry a wallet now with bank cards

## Update after a week

After moving my nano sim over to the Nokia, I've not felt the need to move it back for anything!

### good

- I had a lot of free time now...really!
- I tend to be in the moment more as can't just check my device
- a friend took a photo of my phone as thinks it is a great idea!
- Don't worry as much about phone as only costs £30 so no problem if I lose it
- Kids engage more as don't ask me to play games on my phone
- Friends kids see my phone and they are getting Nokia's too (so good for them to see grown ups using them)
- It's nice make phone calls and not WhatsApp messages. 

### bad

- missed a call due to not hearing (as low volume and phone in bag)
- didn't see messages about missed call due to small screen and not checking
- no idea when bus times are 
- had to remember how to get somewhere as no satnav
- no idea about traffic conditions
- calling my wife hard as her cellphone coverage bad / data is fine
- nervoud about monzo card failing (so am carrying a spare visa card)
- will start carrrying cash
- reception in my house is terrrible and demo sim cards not arrived yet.

## TODO

Is there wifi calling on any feature phone device?

should I try the number clone strategy from Vodaphone?
  so then I can answer calls on my smart phone at home

## Which one to try?

I'm on the Three network in the UK which does not support 2G and like other networks in the UK they are [phasing out 3G](https://www.three.co.uk/support/network-and-coverage/our-plans-to-switch-off-3g). So I need a feature phone that supports 4G calling.

## What is 4G LTE

4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) is entirely IP based. This means all communication including voice is transmitted as data packets.


## Nokia 110 4G

[Official url](https://www.hmd.com/en_int/support/nokia-110-4g-user-guide/keys-and-parts)

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nokia-Feature-Bluetooth-Long-Lasting-Pre-loaded/dp/B0C49SH5TC/?th=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nokia-Feature-Bluetooth-Long-Lasting-Pre-loaded/dp/B0C49SH5TC/?th=1)

[![alt text](/assets/2024-06-29/1.jpg "email"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2024-06-29/1.jpg)

Have ordered this for £29.95

TA-1543 I received (2023 version [i think here](https://www.gsmchoice.com/es/catalogo/nokia/1104g2023dualsim/)?)

2 nano (great same as my new Google pixel 7a) sim cards and an SD card.

Great I can get 4G on the Three network

Games - Snake is available from the Go To menu. Other games can be bought or side loaded

### Button Tones

Settings, Profiles, Normal. Three bars, Settings, Adjust Volume, Key tone (I have mine on 0)

Also turn down all volumes as it is loud. - turned back up as missed calls




## UK Phone Network summary

There are 4 physical phone networks MNO (Major Mobile Network Operators) in the UK. Others such as Tesco piggyback. SIM cards are generally.

- Three - my current provdier. Sporadic coverage in my house. Okay beside windows.
- EE (part of BT Group merger of Orange and T-Mobile). SLighter better in some parts as downgrades to 3G/2G compared with Three. Worse in other parts.
- Vodaphone - slightly better in some parts of house. Same massive black spot in living room.
- O2 (giffgaff) - my wifes (wifi calling not working yet). great website. 

In summary we've got bad network coverage in our village and none of the networks are good enough to run without wifi calling.


## Mobile Virtual Network Operators

According to chatgpt

- Giffgaff: Uses the O2 network.
- Tesco Mobile: Uses the O2 network.
- Virgin Mobile: Uses the Vodafone network.
- Sky Mobile: Uses the O2 network.
- TalkTalk Mobile: Previously used the Vodafone network, but now the service has ceased.
- ASDA Mobile: Uses the Vodafone network.
- BT Mobile: Uses the EE network.
- Plusnet Mobile: Uses the EE network.
- iD Mobile: Uses the Three network.
- Lebara Mobile: Uses the Vodafone network.
- Lycamobile: Uses the O2 network.

## SIM card sizes

- Standard  aka mini. 25mm * 15mm 
- Micro - 15mm * 12mm
- Nano - 12mm * 8mm (iPhone and new Androids)

## Divert Calls to feature phone
asdf

## Vodaphone
has One Number - so my eSim phone and feature phone could have the same number. But txt messages only go to 

Although this seems to be for: smartwatches and tablets to share data allowance

Have ordered a free sim just to experiment with their coverage at my house and in village with bad coverage.


## Wifi Calling

- EE - yes (not confirmed)
- Three - have got it already on my PAYG plan (about £10pm)
- O2 (giffgaff) - [update may 2024](https://community.giffgaff.com/d/34049108-an-update-on-wifi-calling-and-volte)
- Vodaphone - yes 

## Nokia 235

## Nokia 105 - Feature Phone (returned was sent 2G version)

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09K4CTJMJ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09K4CTJMJ) Nokia 105 4G - was £20 when I bought it.

Date first available 2021

This version should work with 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) which is what the Three network runs on in the UK.

This is what is should have been [https://www.hmd.com/en_int/nokia-105-4g/specs?sku=1GF018TPA1H01](https://www.hmd.com/en_int/nokia-105-4g/specs?sku=1GF018TPA1H01) but it wasn't

I was sent the TA-1416 which is the 2G version 

[![alt text](/assets/2024-06-15/1.jpg "email"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2024-06-15/1.jpg)

I liked the

- simplicity
- torch
- a few games for fun

I didn't like:

- sim card hard to take out (and was not a micro sim so had to use an adapter)
- hard to take flimsy case off the at the back and felt like it might break
