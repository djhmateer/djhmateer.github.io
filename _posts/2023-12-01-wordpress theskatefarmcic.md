## Wordpress New Theme - disable auto-formatting

[https://github.com/djhmateer/wordpress-blank-theme](https://github.com/djhmateer/wordpress-blank-theme)

I'm using a custom theme (which is very raw as I want to do all the design work in straigh html then just copy it to WP).

But I need to disable the addition of adding line feeds.

```php
# in functions.php
remove_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' );
```

upload to wp-content/themes/my_custom_theme

chmod the folder so can write to it, and ftp to it. This is useful to make changes to the theme.

Or I could zip the files and: Appearance, Theme to add to wordpress.


## Classic Editor

## Intro

In my series of exploration of LLM's / GPT, lets see if it can help me create a Wordpress website for a new business.

I've done it very successfully with raw [HTML and Tailwind CSS](/2023/10/15/chatgpt4-create-website-homebrew-training). Let's assume you've got a new wordpress instance. I use my own homelab proxmox to create clone of a template VM, then run script to build an Apache2/MySQL/Wordpress install.

This is really part 1, 2 and 3 here. 

1. Coding / code completion / summerisation of code - html / css
2. Assimilating information and summerising  - coming up with project plan / marketing
3. Generation (text / image) - generating content / images
4. Coversation (chatbots)
5. Knowledge accessibility - question and answer 


## Monetisation Strategies for Pressure Washer Rental
 Monetization Strategies for Pressure Washer Hire business: 

`what are good monetisation strategies for running a company that hires out pressure washers to residential customers so they can: clean their wooden decks, furniture and car`

and [Claude]() gives some other insights:

1. Charge per hour of service  
This is the most common approach. Establish an hourly rate that covers your costs and allows for profit. Factor in labor, equipment costs, supplies, insurance, etc.

2. Offer package deals
Such as charging a flat rate for cleaning a deck, patio furniture set, and driveway. Bundling services together can be more appealing to customers.

3. Charge by the square footage  
Determine your average cleaning rate per square foot for different surfaces, and charge accordingly. This allows you to more accurately charge for the actual work being done.

4. Offer membership/subscription packages
Offer discounted rates for customers who sign up for regular pressure washing services, such as quarterly or biannual cleanings. This can help with recurring revenue.

5. Charge extra fees for add-ons
Such as cleaning second stories, using specialty chemicals, stain removal, etc. This lets you earn more from custom work. 

6. Partner with real estate agents  
Offer pressure washing as a value-added service when homes are sold. A clean exterior can make properties more appealing.

7. Upsell additional services
Such as sealing decks or cleaning gutters when doing exterior washing. Expanding the types of services offered can boost revenue.

8. Accept tips  
If providing excellent customer service, clients may be happy to offer a tip. This can supplement income.

The key is finding the right balance between pricing competitively but also profitably based on your unique operating costs and target customer base. Offering multiple pricing options can help maximize earnings.

## Wordpress Creating Simple Tailwind Theme

`how do I create my own theme in wordpress?`

- create new folder in `wp-content/themes/my_custom_theme'`
- add `style.css` and `index.php`

```css
/*
Theme Name: My Custom Theme
Theme URI: http://example.com
Author: Your Name
Author URI: http://example.com
Description: A custom theme for my website.
Version: 1.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Text Domain: my_custom_theme
*/

```

and `can you give me a sample index.php for the theme please`

```php
<?php get_header(); ?>

<div id="main-content">

    <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
        <!-- Start the Loop. -->
        <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

            <article id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>

                <header class="entry-header">
                    <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" rel="bookmark"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
                </header>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <?php the_content('Read More'); ?>
                </div>

                <footer class="entry-footer">
                    <span class="post-date"><?php the_date(); ?></span>
                    <span class="post-category"><?php the_category(', '); ?></span>
                    <span class="post-comments"><?php comments_popup_link('No Comments', '1 Comment', '% Comments'); ?></span>
                </footer>

            </article>

        <?php endwhile; ?>
    <?php else : ?>
        <!-- If no posts are found. -->
        <article class="no-posts">
            <h1>No posts were found.</h1>
        </article>
    <?php endif; ?>

</div>

<?php get_footer(); ?>

```

### Activate the Theme

Appearance, Activate mu_custom_theme

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-16/2.jpg "Simplest possible page")](/assets/2023-10-16/2.jpg)

So this is excellent and looks very simple. And we can edit the text in the admin UI and add new headings.

But the underlying html is still a bit messy.

## Errors and Customise Theme

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-16/3.jpg "There has been a critical error")](/assets/2023-10-16/3.jpg)

`/var/log/apache2/error.log` simplest log file to go to.

## Header.php

`can you give an example of header.php please`

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>

<head>
    <meta charset="<?php bloginfo('charset'); ?>">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="profile" href="https://gmpg.org/xfn/11">
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>

<body <?php body_class(); ?>>

<header id="site-header">
    <div class="container">
        <div id="branding">
            <?php if (has_custom_logo()) : ?>
                <div id="site-logo">
                    <?php the_custom_logo(); ?>
                </div>
            <?php endif; ?>
            <div id="site-title-description">
                <h1><a href="<?php echo esc_url(home_url('/')); ?>"><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></a></h1>
                <p><?php bloginfo('description'); ?></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <nav id="main-navigation">
            <?php
            wp_nav_menu(array(
                'theme_location' => 'primary',
                'menu_id'        => 'primary-menu',
            ));
            ?>
        </nav>
    </div>
</header>

<div id="content" class="site-content">

```

lets simplify so that wordpress is just doing content editing

## Gutenberg

`what is gutenberg editing in wordpress?`

It is a block editor. And is outputting

```html
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About</h2>
<p>We are here to serve!</p>
```

**PLAN**
So now we have a super simple html site where content is editable in the backend of Wordpress, and getting the class names correct for tailwindCSS.


## HTML simplifying

index.php in my theme

```php
<!-- just the head and no content in header -->
<?php get_header(); ?>

<body class="bg-gray-100">

 <!-- Header -->
 <div class="bg-blue-600 text-white py-4 text-center">
    <h1 class="text-4xl">Kingston Pressure Washer Rentals</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">Best pressure washers in Kingston near Lewes</p>
</div>


<!-- Main content -->
<div class="container mx-auto mt-10 px-4">

    <!-- About Section -->
    <!-- how do I get this in wordpress with the correct class names? -->
    <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">About Us</h2>
        <p>We've been providing top-notch pressure washers for hire in Kingston and the nearby Lewes area for over a decade. Whether you have a small patio or a large industrial site, we have the right equipment for you.</p>
    </section>

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4"><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
    
    <?php the_content(); ?>

</div>

<!-- footer text, end body and html in footer -->
<?php get_footer(); ?>
```
Am starting to manually patchin in tailwind css

## Error Log for Wordpress

`/var/www/html/wp-config.php` 
```
if ( ! defined( 'WP_DEBUG' ) ) {
        define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
}

// DM
// Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
```

To get it to produce an error, make a php typo in functions.php in the theme.

## Gutenberg editor with TailwindCSS

`how do I get the wordpress Gutenberg editor to display tailwindcss?`

Looks like I have to wire up specific wp block css to the relevant tailwind


Then can use tailwindCSS in html

Just make sure the stylesheet is linked in the header.

```html
 <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

TailPress - plugin and ?  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailpress/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailpress/)... 

## Conclusion

Using LLM's greatly helps in starting projects for

- Monetisation strategies
- Pricing
- Other ways to make money from an initial idea
- Creating HTML
- Porting to Wordpress

What I like about this process is that you get to see results fast, and it becomes obvious when an idea should be taken forward. 

However I would argue that before building any sort of website, you'd want to do more of the business planning and marketing side.. so that is my next article.
