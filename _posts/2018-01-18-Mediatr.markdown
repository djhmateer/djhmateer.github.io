### Summary
First thoughts looking at the Mediatr library.
[https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/cqrs-using-mediatr-asp-net-core](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/cqrs-using-mediatr-asp-net-core) 

### Why Use Mediatr? 
In process messaging - a way of easily splitting up the application. Driving towards microservices?

### Simple Example 
{% highlight csharp %}

{% endhighlight %}

### Using Dapper (Async)
asdf

### Passing a List<ViewModel>
asdf

### Cancellation Tokens
I don't forsee users having to manually cancel any of the async jobs, so am ignoring the cancellation tokens.
