[From Dan Clarks Tweet on Succinct C#](https://twitter.com/dracan/status/1259424188756111367)

There were some recommendations to learn F# (again), so perhaps it may be fun again.

What is F#

What is the history of it?

FP fervour

When is it a better fit than C#

Is it a smart language to learn
  ie a slighly higher barrier to entry
  more high quality examples out there
  
Is anyone using it in production / can I get a job using F#?
  ie like Haskell 
  Scala 
  Clojure

Is JavaScript acutally a great FP?

Basic syntax

Web crawler in F#

How to make more immutable data structures in F#
  and call from C#

Making a DSL with F#
 use it for a structured testing tool????

Pipelines?

Other great use cases for F#


I can highly recommend 
@isaac_abraham
's book along with 
@kitlovesfsharp
's Stylish F# to follow.
