I'm implementing a 'Speech Parts' tools for [https://osr4rightstools.org/](https://osr4rightstools.org/). A collaborator has put together Python code to do it using [https://pypi.org/project/speechbrain/](https://pypi.org/project/speechbrain/)

[VM Build Script](https://github.com/osr4rightstools/osr4rights-tools/blob/main/4audioSpeechPartsCPU/create-cpu-vm.sh) shows how to install dependencies.

[Python code and shell scripts](https://github.com/spatial-intelligence/OSR4Rights/tree/main/AudioTools)

Essentially we

- Take audio files in the form of .mp3, .ogg, .flac, m4a or video in .webm, .mp4
- Use ffmpeg to convert these tiles to .wav audio
- Use Python to run SpeechBrain to extract only the parts with audio
- Save the clips only with audio
- Print out corresponding frames where they are.

## Footage

Use cases for this tool include:

- CCTV Camera analysis to see where there is speech audio which may be interesting (ie if lots of silence and only a bit of audio we want to know where)

- Bodycam footage

YouTube can provide us with samples to test the system:

[Bodycam footage of police during Minneapolic protests - BBC News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia61BF-dokA) 3minutes 30secs.

[cctv 1 hour version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbXOhnudzxk) - 1hour

[Longest Video Ever On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct8nZ6eTTiY) - 9hours 15minutes, 393MB

[100 Hour Timer Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56lkofpjOAs) - 100 hours. Approx 3GB

## Youtube dlp

To get these raw files I used [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

[Installation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation)

```bash
# worked on Ubuntu 20
sudo apt install yt-dlp

# WSL2 Ubuntu 18 I used another method.. pip perhaps?

# this gets an mp4 or whatever is 'best'

```

## Performance

Converting raw video to .WAV can create huge files.

>4GB is a problem for WAV files. [RF64](https://superuser.com/questions/1523596/ffmpeg-input-6-x-24-bit-mono-but-output-5-1-16-bit) can help

Essentially I found that with a VM of size:

- 32GB RAM
- 32GB Disk Space
- 2 Core AMD (ffmpeg and SpeechBrain implementations both single threaded) Use AMD as slightly cheaper

I could successfully process up to

- 30 min, 800MB video mp4 file (expands to 60MB WAV)
- 1 hour, 174MB vide (expands to 680MB)
- 9 hour, 393MB video file. (expands to 2.9GB WAV)
