V2 access levels

- Essential - 500k tweets per month, 1 project per account, 1 App environment per Project. Limited access to standard v1.1 (only media endpoints)
- Elevated
- Academic Research - access to full-archive search and advanced serach operators

I had to fill out forms to get access, and had to go for Elevated. It looked like a manual process but in fact was instantaneous.
