So as a old programmer I've been asked a few times:

> "How do I get started in programming"

So I've gone from being a geek when I was 8 years old to about 16 playing computer games and messing with my Dad's ZX 81 then geting a ZX Spectrum,  Amstrad PC1512, old BBS's with 1200 baud modem. Then I totally got into engineering / rock climbing / travelling / being an outdoor instructor.

When I was about 29 I 'got my foot in the door' with a friend of the family's company. I was a total junior and learned all about TCP/IP networking, Sun Solaris, Novell Netware, IT Support, RedHat Linux, Apache, PHP (building from source). I did mostly IT support and got my first taste of programming with PHP.  

So to highlight - the important part here was getting an initial job doing something to do with computers. After that it has been easy to change within the industry. For me it has gone from IT towards programming.

## Do you enjoy messing around with computers

What stories do you have 
Building your own machines -  CPU's / Graphics cards?
Messed around with HTML / CSS / Javascript / Python

## It's about people

Communication- can you talk to people?
Technical skills can be taught/picked up by someone who is interested

## Are you a good person

Will you turn up on time at work?
Will you be a good person to work with / can talk to other people (I got a job once I wasn't really qualified for, by telling really bad jokes, and I think people liked it as it showed I can at least talk to people!)

## CV / Resume

something is good
what about a resume website on Github Pages?

## Go to local user groups

This is a wonderful way to meet people and get your foot in the door. 

## Do you use GitHub

Have some projects to talk about / demo when you meet people

Is there a project on Github you can talk about that you're excited about?

## Do you have Stackoverflow account

Answering others questions is a wonderful challenge

## What are your favourite tools and plugins

- Onenote
- VS Code
- Cmder
- Resharper for Visual Studio

## Are you reasonably presentable and clean

Showering is important
Black t shirt and jeans
Good haircut

## Fun programming challenges

Project Euler

## Bootcamps
