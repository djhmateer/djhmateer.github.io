So as an ~~experienced~~ old (!) programmer I've been asked a few times:

> "How do I get started in programming"

I've gone from being a geek when I was 8 years old to about 16 playing computer games and messing with my Dad's [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) then getting a [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum),  [Amstrad PC1512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC1512), old BBS's with 1200 baud modem. Then I totally got into engineering / rock climbing / travelling / being an outdoor instructor.

When I was about 29 I 'got my foot in the door' with a friend of the family's company. I was a total junior and learned all about TCP/IP networking, Sun Solaris, Novell Netware, IT Support, RedHat Linux, Apache, PHP (building from source). I did mostly IT support and got my first taste of programming with the newly released PHP3.

So to highlight - the important part here was **getting an initial job doing something to do with computers**. After that it has been easy to change within the industry. For me it has gone from IT towards programming.

## Do you enjoy messing around with computers

This may seem a strange first title, but do you actually like computers (I guess you probably do), or are you after a job in programming just for the money (unusual but I've seen it).

- What stories do you have
- Building your own machines -  CPU's / Graphics cards?
- Messed around with HTML / CSS / Javascript / Python

## It's about people

- Communication - can you talk to people?
- Technical skills can be taught/picked up by someone who is interested

## Are you a good person

- Will you turn up on time at work?
- Will you be a good person to work with / can talk to other people (I got a job once I wasn't really qualified for, by telling really bad jokes, and I think people liked it as it showed I can at least talk to people!)

## CV / Resume

- something is good
- what about a resume website on Github Pages?

## Go to local user groups

- This is a wonderful way to meet people and get your foot in the door. 

## Do you use GitHub

- Have some projects to talk about / demo when you meet people

Is there a project on Github you can talk about that you're excited about?

## Do you have Stack Overflow account

Answering others questions is a wonderful challenge

## What are your favourite tools and plugins

- Onenote
- VS Code
- Cmder
- Resharper for Visual Studio

## Are you reasonably presentable and clean

- Showering is important
- Black t shirt and jeans
- Good haircut

## Fun programming challenges

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a wonderful set of programming challenges. When I'm learning a new language I often go back to the first question and start again. Or if I'm trying a [new style of programming](/2018/09/20/Improve-Programming-using-Project-Euler)

[https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) is a interesting place to hang out too.

## Bootcamps

## Twitter

- Follow people in your local area that look interesting
- Follow industry leaders eg @shanselman in C#, @troyhunt in security, @ploeh for functional programming, @nick_craver for SO, @stevejgordon for C#, @mikehadlow for C#, @richcampbell and @carlfranklin dotnetrocks podcast.

- Ask politely for others to help in getting your first job eg look at these conversations:

## LinkedIn

This could be a good resource and always worth trying. [I'm here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-mateer-6274942/) if I can help.

## Resources

- Get good at googling!
- [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) written 20 years ago and still very relevant!
