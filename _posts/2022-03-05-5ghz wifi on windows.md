My Apple iPhone 6 and MBP's can all successfully connect to my wifi router (which has 2.4GHz and 5GHz broadcasting as the same name) quickly and get the full 300/100 on speedtest.net

My windows devices including a lenovo laptop and desktop with a wifi card cannot. They only connect at the 2.4GHz speed, so get much lower download speeds.

So the router does work at 5GHz successfully

I do have another internet connection and have separate broadcast names for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The 5GHz works fine on the windows devices


## Desktop

The problem - why can't my desktop connect to the SSID on 5GHz?

Here is the same desktop connecting to another 5GHz SSID. So the networking card can support 5GHz.

## Mac

The Mac can connect to the SSID on 5GHz.

Option and click on the WiFi symbol to get these diagnostics

Control Panel, Devices, Preferred Band of 5GHz. Makes no difference.
