## Install Promox
[https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve) Version: 7.1-2

I uysed balenaEtcher to create a boot USB.

### Network setup

FQDN: pve.dave.home

PVE is Promox Virtual Environment

My home subnet from DHCP on the router is: 192.168.1.x
DHCP range is 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.253

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/static.jpg "static")](/assets/2022-01-13/static.jpg)

I've assigned pve to be on 192.168.1.139 and forced the DHCP table to not assign it to anything else.


## Web

[https://192.168.1.139:8006/](https://192.168.1.139:8006/)

u: root
p:


```bash
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
mv pve-enterprise.list pve-enterprise.list.disabled
# careful of debian version
# version 7
echo 'deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription' > pve-community.list
# version 6
echo 'deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription' > pve-community.list
apt update
apt -y dist-upgrade
```

Promox 7 runs on Bullseye

Proxmox version 5 instead of 6, change “buster” to “stretch” in line three. These are version names for Debian releases, Proxmox versions 5 and 6 run on Debian Stretch and Buster respectively.

## Secure Boot Problem

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/boot.jpg "secure boot")](/assets/2022-01-13/boot.jpg)

After rebooting from udpates above I got a Secure Boot Violation warning from my BIOS

The solution was to go into the BIOS - Boot, then change the order of the boot devices to be the M2 drive and not the UEFI boot loader device.

## Create a VM

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/upload.jpg "upload")](/assets/2022-01-13/upload.jpg)

Upload ISO from workstation

Create VM:

- Name: webserver-test
- OS: Ubuntu (just uploaded)
- Disks: 32GB (Default)
- CPU: 1 Socket, 2 Cores
- Memory: 2048MB (Default)


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg "start")](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg)

Start it

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg "start")](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg)

It works! However

Got a DHCP address of: 192.168.1.140/24 which is an address gives from the routers DHCP server.

Ubuntu server install

server name: webserver-test-ubuntu
u: dave


put on SSH Server too.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/ssh.jpg "ssh")](/assets/2022-01-13/ssh.jpg)

After the Ubuntu server installtion completes (a few minutes), and a reboot, I could access the VM from my workstation

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/wired.jpg "wired routes")](/assets/2022-01-13/wired routes.jpg)

Can see the pve hypervisor on .139, and the newly created VM with it's correct linux servername I gave above when I named the server (not in pve).

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```
