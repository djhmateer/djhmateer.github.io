> Use Next.js like it's PHP/Rails but with React when you need it

- Next.js (App Router)
- Shadcn/ui and Tailwind
- Drizzle
- Postgres

Perhaps

- Lucia or NextAuth or Auth.js - for auth
- Railway/Render - VM for background jobs, websockets, and solid logging, and cost savings


## Bar

I'm building a greenfield app in 2025. I will probably need React on the frontend for some parts of the app to do complex forms and to use the design system shadcn/ui. Other parts of the system are simple CRUD and don't need react. I'd like to host on a VM and have a database. What are my options?

what about other design systems that aren't shadcn/ui?

## Foo

`In next.js or astro, when should one use React and when should one use a server based data fetching / html generational model?

I've used server side frameworks for years such as asp.net, php, ruby on rails. Hosted on a single VM with a separate DB, they can handle huge loads and are easy to debug.

With the advent of react and client side framworks which make javascript interacticity easy they are very commong. 

Firstly why should one use React? What are they parts of a CRUD based application that it shines in?`


### When React is the right tool

React shines anywhere your UI has long-lived client state or rich interactions that would be clumsy as full page reloads.

Sweet spots in CRUD apps

- **Inline editing & optimistic UI** Editable tables, drag-to-reorder, multi-select with bulk actions, undo/snackbar flows.

- **Complex forms**. Conditional fields, debounced validation, nested arrays (e.g., invoices with line items), rich editors, wizards.

- **Realtime views**. Presence indicators, live counters, notifications, collaborative cursors; WebSocket/SSE hooks.

- Reusable design systems. Where a component library and composition pay off across the app.

If a screen is mostly read → click → navigate, React is often overkill.


## How to use Next.js 

If we need React (and I'd argue it is necessary for most modern day apps)

For small teams lets flatten the stack:

- Server-first to prevent edge cases, cache revalidation, hydration drift
- VM hosting allows simple logs
- Keep client JS minimal and intentional

## Minimal Next.js stack

As with other stacks where I've been frustrated by complexity (well, frustrated by my own lack of knowledge usually!), lets take the good parts of Next.js and make a great simple stack.

With .NET I found an incredible sweet spot which made developing apps a breeze. I wrote a massive blog post series, and understood the stack well.

- No caching
- No massive ORM (Entity Framework!) but favour simplicity like Dapper
- Migrations I didn't even use
- Keep layers of abstration as simple as possible ie usually only 1 db.cs import (along with global auth)
- Self host so I can reliably deploy (with a bash script to build) and have massive performance.

So with Next.js I wonder

- Server Side Rendering 
- No caching
- Self host on raw VM - just use nginx and node (using pnpm)..systemd.. zero downtime deploy with sym link so can revert.
- Postgres
- Shadcn/ui for pre-built great looking components
-
