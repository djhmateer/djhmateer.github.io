> Use Next.js like it's PHP/Rails but with React when you need it

- Next.js (App Router)
- Shadcn/ui and Tailwind
- Drizzle
- Postgres

Perhaps

- Lucia or NextAuth or Auth.js - for auth
- Railway/Render - VM for background jobs, websockets, and solid logging, and cost savings


## Bar

I'm building a greenfield app in 2025. I will probably need React on the frontend for some parts of the app to do complex forms and to use the design system shadcn/ui. Other parts of the system are simple CRUD and don't need react. I'd like to host on a VM and have a database. What are my options?

what about other design systems that aren't shadcn/ui?

## Foo

[https://chatgpt.com/share/68d54d0f-0080-8006-a294-650b0b1e9c00](https://chatgpt.com/share/68d54d0f-0080-8006-a294-650b0b1e9c00)

`In next.js or astro, when should one use React and when should one use a server based data fetching / html generational model?

I've used server side frameworks for years such as asp.net, php, ruby on rails. Hosted on a single VM with a separate DB, they can handle huge loads and are easy to debug.

With the advent of react and client side framworks which make javascript interacticity easy they are very commong. 

Firstly why should one use React? What are they parts of a CRUD based application that it shines in?`


### When React is the right tool

React shines anywhere your UI has long-lived client state or rich interactions that would be clumsy as full page reloads.

Sweet spots in CRUD apps

- **Inline editing & optimistic UI** Editable tables, drag-to-reorder, multi-select with bulk actions, undo/snackbar flows.

- **Complex forms**. Conditional fields, debounced validation, nested arrays (e.g., invoices with line items), rich editors, wizards.

- **Realtime views**. Presence indicators, live counters, notifications, collaborative cursors; WebSocket/SSE hooks.

- Reusable design systems. Where a component library and composition pay off across the app.

If a screen is mostly read → click → navigate, React is often overkill.


## How to use Next.js 

If we need React (and I'd argue it is necessary for most modern day apps)

[https://chatgpt.com/share/68d62c71-f5ac-8006-b689-5bf33bfcd055](https://chatgpt.com/share/68d62c71-f5ac-8006-b689-5bf33bfcd055)

For small teams lets flatten the stack:

- Server-first to prevent edge cases, cache revalidation, hydration drift
- VM hosting allows simple logs
- Keep client JS minimal and intentional

## Minimal Next.js stack

As with other stacks where I've been frustrated by complexity (well, frustrated by my own lack of knowledge usually!), lets take the good parts of Next.js and make a great simple stack.

With .NET I found an incredible sweet spot which made developing apps a breeze. I wrote a massive blog post series, and understood the stack well.

- No caching
- No massive ORM (Entity Framework!) but favour simplicity like Dapper
- Migrations I didn't even use
- Keep layers of abstration as simple as possible ie usually only 1 db.cs import (along with global auth)
- Self host so I can reliably deploy (with a bash script to build) and have massive performance.

So with Next.js I wonder

- Server Side Rendering 
- No caching
- Self host on raw VM - just use nginx and node (using pnpm)..systemd.. zero downtime deploy with sym link so can revert.
- Postgres
- Shadcn/ui for pre-built great looking components


## Self Host

[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying)


[https://medium.com/upcloud/how-to-deploy-next-js-to-cloud-servers-a-step-by-step-guide-bb078bfff6f4](https://medium.com/upcloud/how-to-deploy-next-js-to-cloud-servers-a-step-by-step-guide-bb078bfff6f4)

In the spirit of just code.. and get something working..

- Create a self hosted VM
- bash script to install everything needed for Next.js 
- run a deployment straight to the Next.js server (no nginx yet)

```bash
# Node Version Manager - nvm

# https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
# check the version number and put below. This is an update script as well
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

# restart shell or 
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion


# 0.40.3 on 29th Sept 25
nvm -v

## node 22.20.0 on 12th Oct 25
nvm install --lts

# 10.9.3
npm -v

# update npm.. now 11.6.1 on 29th Sept 25
npm install -g npm

# **TODO - a better more direct way on installing pnpm? so can update more easily**
# 10.17.1
npm install -g pnpm


cd /var/www
git clone 

# pnpm install
pnpm i

# pnpm update
# update all packages to latest..hmm react-dom from 19.1.0 to 19.1.1
pnpm up --latest

# Nginx
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

# service
mkdir /srv/

sudo git clone https://github.com/djhmateer/minimal-nextjs.git

sudo git clone https://github.com/patrickbower/spotscore.git

# fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/srv/spotscore'
git config --global --add safe.directory /srv/spotscore
sudo git checkout dave

## chown to a deploy user?

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /srv/minimal-nextjs
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /srv/spotscore

# sudo chmod +x /srv/minimal-nextjs/
sudo chmod 777 /srv/minimal-nextjs/

# so can create node_modules etc.
sudo chmod 777 -R /srv/spotscore

pnpm i
pnpm run build


# for if git folder has a different owner ie www-root
sudo git config --global --add safe.directory /srv/minimal-nextjs

# nginx is on my reverse proxy
#sudo cp /srv/minimal-nextjs/infra/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

# test the config
# sudo nginx -t

# sudo nginx -s reload

# systemd or pm2

# manual testing - run the next start server as defined in package.json
pnpm -- start

# test process is running
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000

```

then following the [automated installation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation)

```bash

# 15.5.4 on 29th Sept 25
# https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app
# pnpx create-next-app@latest minimal-nextjs --ts --eslint --tailwind --no-src-dir --app --turbopack --no-import-alias --use-pnpm

pnpx create-next-app@latest dave_app --ts --biome --tailwind --no-src-dir --app --turbopack --no-import-alias --use-pnpm

cd minimal-nextjs

# post install scripts
# tailwindcss_oxide
# unrs-resolver
# sharp
pnpm approve-builds

# http://localhost:3000/
pnpm dev
```

###  Testing locally

I don't have any domain names at the moment, so lets just hit the webserver locally by ip

pfsense2 is on 192.168.1.179
:8080 is pfsense

:80 is just the default reverse proxy ie pfsense forwards to 172.16.44.104 (NGINX-RP)

how about pfsense redirects port 81 to 172.16.44.130:3000

http://192.168.1.179:81/


[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/1.jpg "Sample page")](/assets/2025-09-30/1.jpg)

A production build of a sample next.js project.

js is cached well in browser

I changed a file to Dave2 in source, then on the sever

```bash
# 9 seconds to lint, build and start on desktop and server
pnpm build
pnpm start
pnpm lint 
```

### Node.js

When run `pnpm run build` it runs `next build` which

- Transpiles TS/JSX
- Bundles client-side assets
- Prepared .next/ directory with optimised output
- Runs static optimisation and prerenders any SSG pages
- Prepares server code for SSR routes

`pnpm start` 

- Runs `next start` - next.js's minimal Node server that uses build output in `.next/`. Internally known as `NextNodeServer`
- serves prebuilt static assets
- handes SSR (Server Side Rendering)
- provides routing based on the filesystem and middleware


### Filesystem

I got Turbopack’s filesystem benchmark of 136ms warning. The disk iops on my hypervisor were going hard with other work. ZFS on RAID1. 

todo - boot my filesystem


### Middleware for logging

I like to see everything on the server

```ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request) {
  const start = Date.now()

  const response = NextResponse.next()
  const duration = Date.now() - start

  console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${request.method} ${request.nextUrl.pathname} - ${duration}ms`)

  response.headers.set('x-response-time', `${duration}ms`)

  return response
}

// defines which paths will invoke the middleware
//   - /(...) - Match paths starting with /
//   - (?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico) - Negative lookahead: Don't match these patterns
// also svgs
//   - .* - Match everything else
export const config = {
  matcher: '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.svg).*)',
}
```
and 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Step 1: Pulling latest changes..."
git pull

echo "Step 2: Building application..."
step_start=$(date +%s)
pnpm build
step_end=$(date +%s)
echo "Build completed in $((step_end - step_start)) seconds"

echo "Step 3: Starting application..."

# Have got middleware.js for logging on prod
pnpm start

# noisy
# DEBUG=next:* pnpm start

# still noisy
# DEBUG=next:router-server:main pnpm start
```
and now we have logging.. can't get response code due to limitaion on middleware logging. [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45099922](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45099922)

I'll be logging via nginx in prod.

## Biome

[https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/)

```bash

# same as pnpm run lint
pnpm exec biome check

# apply safe fixes
pnpm exec biome lint --write

# same as pnpm run format
pnpm exec biome format --write
```

In VSCode I had to put in the path as I'm using a subdirectory `dave_app/node_modules` for my app.

```json
// /.vscode/settings.json
{
  "biome.lspBin": "./dave_app/node_modules/@biomejs/biome/bin/biome"
}
```


## SSR (Server Side Rendering)

SSG - Server Side Generated (ie 'static' and not good for db calls)

```ts
// app/page.tsx

export const dynamic = 'force-static'

const Homepage = () => {
  const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl mb-4">Home</h1>
      <p>this data is the next.js default of statically generated on the server - Server Side Generated. Build time: {currentTime}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Homepage;
```

SSR - Server Side Rendered.. async by convention. 

```ts
// app/about/page.tsx

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

// note async!
const AboutPage = async () => {
  const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
    
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl mb-4">About</h1>
      <p>build time is (ie page data is Server Side Rendered on each request {currentTime}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AboutPage;
```

[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/2.jpg "Dynamic")](/assets/2025-09-30/2.jpg)

`pnpm build` output shows which routes are dynamic and which are static.


## Server and Client Components

By default layouts and pages are Server Components.

Server vs Client Components is determined by "use client" directive
    - No "use client" = Server Component (your case)
    - Has "use client" = Client Component
    
export const dynamic controls when/how the component renders on the server:
    - 'force-static' = Pre-rendered at build time (SSG)
    - 'force-dynamic' = Rendered on each request (SSR)
    - 'auto' = Next.js decides


When you navigate between routes, Next.js unmounts the current page component, an mounts the new one.  So that is why the state returns to 0 after clicking away.

Could use localStorage, or state in the layout component as this stays mounted.

[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/3.jpg "minimaljs")](/assets/2025-09-30/3.jpg)

`minimal-nextjs` shows a good flow of understanding concepts. Having a production server vm is invaluable

## Params

Param ie /users/1

[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/4.jpg "prefetch")](/assets/2025-09-30/4.jpg)

To stop prefetch when I'm on /users/2 I set all links to `prefetch={false}`


## Custom 404

not-found.tsx

## Loading State

loading.tsx

The loading.tsx file only appears when Next.js is **waiting for the Server Component to finish rendering**... so it doesn't work when waiting for data over the wire?

It is a client component, so will be cached on the client. 

I have seen it fail for no apparent reason.

I've got a global loading.tsx page which I testing.

## DB

### shadcn to explore

[https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/tasks](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/tasks) - filter, sort grid...looks great.

## shadcn mcp server

[https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/mcp](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/mcp)

```json
// .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadcn": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["shadcn@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

then if I do `/mcp` in claude it shows me the connected server.

`Show me all available components in the shadcn registry`

`Add the button, dialog and card components to my project`

## Form with Claude-code and Shadcn

`Create a contact form using components from the shadcn registry`

It did

` pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add form input textarea card label  `


[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/7.jpg "asdf")](/assets/2025-09-30/7.jpg)

Firstly this is a client component with `use client`

 * - react-hook-form for form state management
 * - zod for schema validation
 * - shadcn/ui components for UI
 * - sonner for toast notifications

I got lots of errors using `http://192.168.1.179:81/` - my browser extension getting confused with another site on this ip and throwing browser console errors, so am using the `http://pfsense2:81/` for now

- Card
- Form

Now trying to understand all parts of the code.

- head towards simplest possible
- want to do server side call to write to db, send emails etc..

## Version Mismatch


[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/8.jpg "Version mismatch")](/assets/2025-09-30/8.jpg)

I deployed a newer version to the server and this confused the client, but it did seem to recover and all pages are now using the latest version.


## Server

Lets get a simple server log to console working first.

- What is the actions.ts strategy?


### React-hook-form

Installed with `Form` shadcn as this component uses it 

RHF handles

- Form state (tracking input values)
- Validation
- Error message
- Form submittion

Lets try using without using the Form wrapper?

## Custom slash command to help with git commit message

found that it is a bit slow (claude) for commit messages
and I'm out of free credits

/cp

## Kill old session

When terminal sessions get stopped (zombied) it is useful when reconnecting to kill off the old session in the ./go.sh script.

```bash
# sudo apt install -y net-tools
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 3000 | awk '{print $7}' | cut -d'/' -f1 | xargs -r sudo kill -9

```

## Chrome devtools mcp

```json
// .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadcn": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["shadcn@latest", "mcp"]
    },
     "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

It seems to be taking snapshots of the page, and iterating back to make sure they work.

`go through each page and take snapshots in the test-snapshots directory`
`go through each page and check for console errors and take snapshots in the test-snapshots directory`

## UX Questions

I've found myself asking what are the best practises for a crud style application using next.js?

I've got a backend style which I like (minimal, fast etc..)

But what are great examples?

[https://nextjs.org/learn](https://nextjs.org/learn) features
 - dashboard style
 - gradi with filter, order?, paging
 - modal create
 - modal edit and delete

[https://vercel.com/templates](https://vercel.com/templates)


## Is Next.js the right choice for a business crud app?

hmmmm - should I be doing this all in next.js / react? Currently not really my choice as I want to use this tech to make that decision.

[https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-next-js](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-next-js)


## Laggyness

Even with a simple table of 8 products I've noticed that the UI feels laggy which something important I'd like to address.

turns out it was laggy!

- had a conflicting css class which led to a double paint
- changed to darker in table.tsx
- modal took out the animation in and out transitions and now feels instant

## Persistence

Let's get the database working forcussing on

- simplicity
- performance


## Error.tsx and global-error.tsx

`global-error` is the top level

`error.tsx` would show if for a example there is 1 failed fetch in a single route.

`Application error: a server-side exception has occurred while loading 192.168.1.179 (see the server logs for more information).
Digest: 3149050583` style errors

## Persistence

Digging into a real life form with a lot of data. Lets do the simplest thing for performance.

Getting .env.development and .env.production wired up correctly.


## Pagination

Performance - large dom's be careful. A few hundred rows should be fine with pagination.

First strategy I tried was with 1200 products and loading all data into browser but only rendering 20 at a time - felt snappy.

However I'll be dealing with much more data. Maybe 100k rows.

even 100k rows of data was only 27MB.. and JS dealt with it fine.

1m rows gave some issues, which were hard to debug as it was internal to next.js was causing the bottleneck.

So I went with pagination (see crude) using a non-page reload


## Filtering 
asdf

## Upgrade to Next 16

[https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16)

```bash
pnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

[https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy) - rename middleware.ts to proxy.ts

Have got faster build time - 8 seconds to 6 seconds on prod

## Sorting

I've gone for simple sql based sorting.

- Server Side Rendering for data fetch
- Server Action for form submittion (not implemented)
- Client Component for rendering, routes and modal popup

## Authentication (better-auth)

[https://www.better-auth.com/](https://www.better-auth.com/)

Lets try and get the simplest possible thing working - emailAndPassword

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http better-auth https://mcp.chonkie.ai/better-auth/better-auth-builder/mcp
```

In this new era of llms, lets connect the mcp and try and implement that way! I asked it to do step by step

[https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation)


[https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-auth)

```bash
# 1.3.34 on 29th Oct 2025
pnpm add better-auth

# generate a secret
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret

# Better Auth Secret in .env.development
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=xxxxxxx
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

then in 

```ts
// lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Pool({
    user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
    password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
    host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST,
    database: process.env.POSTGRES_DATABASE,
    port: parseInt(process.env.POSTGRES_PORT || "5432"),
  }),
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  secret: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
  baseURL: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_URL,
});

```
Notice that I'm using a Pool here, as this is recommended for auth.

```bash
# generate tables
npx @better-auth/cli generate

# creates a better-auth_migrations file which generates the 4 new tables below
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

[![alt text](/assets/2025-09-30/11.jpg "DB Tables")](/assets/2025-09-30/11.jpg)

Notice singular for table names. Not canonical for postgres, but am leaving for now.

```bash
sudo -i -u postgres
psql
```
for easy testing.

```sql
-- user table a bit annoying as when I do select * from user, it thinks I mean the postgres table and not public.

```

### step 5 - mount handler

```ts
// api/auth/[...all]/route.ts
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const { GET, POST } = toNextJsHandler(auth.handler);
```

A catch all which will handle all better auth api endpoints:

  - /api/auth/sign-up/email - User registration
  - /api/auth/sign-in/email - User login
  - /api/auth/sign-out - User logout
  - /api/auth/session - Get current session
  - And many more...

  The toNextJsHandler() adapter converts Better Auth's handler to work with Next.js 15 App Router's route handlers, supporting both GET and POST requests.


## step 6 - create auth-client.ts

```ts
// lib/auth-client.ts
// will use this in React components


import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
});
```
