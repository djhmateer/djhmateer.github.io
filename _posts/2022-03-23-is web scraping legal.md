TL;DR - Yes, web scraping is legal for a publicly available website. ie not behind a login. Personal information storage is different and comes under GDPR in the UK.


## Twitter

For a project I've got a few thousand tweets URL's that I need to get data and images/video for. They are > 7 days old.

So I can't use the API to get the data.

Is it legal to scrape the data from the public website?

[https://twitter.com/en/tos](https://twitter.com/en/tos) from the Terms of Service it looks like you are not allowed to scrape their data.

However here is a lawyers guiide [https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/) to the legality.

> Web scraping is legal if you scrape data publicly available on the internet. But some kinds of data are protected by international regulations, so be careful scraping personal data, intellectual property, or confidential data. Respect your target websites and use empathy to create ethical scrapers.
