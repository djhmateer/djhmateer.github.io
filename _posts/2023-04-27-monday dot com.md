I'm exploring various scheduling tools for employees

The current system is on Google Spreadsheets, and we need much more control and workflows to stop errors

However we would love to keep the flexibility of a spreadsheet system

And not have the cost of a custom built SaaS product which is in the realm of ¬£40k per year for 600 employees.


## What is Monday.com?
Is it a spreadsheet with automation and workflow?



There is good undo (Trash)
Keyboard shortcuts looks good
Multi select looks good

## Terminology

Workspace - contains Items eg Board, Doc, Dashboard, Form. All team members are in workspace.

Board - like a worksheet. everything is a board

Groups (top level)
Items - can be anything eg Clients, Deals, Meetings, Bugs.. anything you need to manage
Sub Items


Column - can have type eg Numbers, People, Status, Date, Location, Files

Item - like a row in a spreadsheet

Table

## Demo

[Monday.com Review & Tutorial (Best for New Users üëç)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKAVqB5n4ko)
Duplicate board is handy

Sorting is handy


Handy to stop using email chains, and to use it in here as project management
so other people can see email chains!
