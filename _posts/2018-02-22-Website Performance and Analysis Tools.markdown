Here are some of my favourite tools for web perf and analytics:

[Uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com) - Free tier. 50 monitors. Sends a request every 5 minutes to a website.

[Pingdom.com](https://www.pingdom.com) - Free tier. Gives average response times.

Azure have an excellent uptime monitor inside Application Insights  

[Builtwith.com](https://builtwith.com) - eg is this a wordpress site, what webserver etc..

[Deadlinkchecker.com](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com) This handles redirects well


[Apache benchmarks](/apachebenchmarks/2018/02/01/Apache-Benchmarks.html) load testing from the command line
