## Technical People 

Domain name registration [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/) are excellent. Current price is $15 per year for a domain then $5 per month for servicing on that domain. [DNS Simple Pricing](https://dnsimple.com/pricing)  

[Name Mesh domain name checker](https://www.namemesh.com) excellent!

[fasthosts domain name checker](https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/domain-names) eg agoyal.co.uk and useful for a Â£5 for first year .co.uk domain

I'm trialing [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) as they give wholesale costs on domains ie $8.03 for a .com domain. Currently they are [transfer in only (not new domains).
