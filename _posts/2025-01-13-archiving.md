If you have a URL link, and want to archive the contents, what tools are available in 2025?

## What do you want?

- Screenshot of the page
- Images download
- Videos download
- All the assets eg CSS / JS / HTML

## Who are the customers?

I've worked for the past 4 years in Human Rights, where the focus has been on images and video archiving. Screenshots are imporant too for verification. Text content and reading of the websites is less important.

 Human rights organisations
 Journalists
 Insurance investigators
 Discussion websites eg Hacker news - to get around paywalls

## Internet Archive aka Wayback Machine

There is an API so can post to here (we do this in the auto-archiver)
