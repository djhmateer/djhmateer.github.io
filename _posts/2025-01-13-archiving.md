If you have a link, and want to archive the contents, what tools are available in 2025?

## What do you want?

- Screenshot of the page
- Images download
- Videos download
- All the assets eg CSS / JS / HTML


## Who are the customers?

I've worked for the past 4 years in Human Rights, where the focus has been on images and video archiving. Screenshots are imporant too for verification.



 Human rights organisations
 Journalists
 Insurance investigators
 Discussion websites eg Hacker news - to get around paywalls
