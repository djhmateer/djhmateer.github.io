This is server being built by [https://www.quietpc.com/](https://www.quietpc.com/) as I need one fast and don't want to build it myself

Use case is

- Proxmox
- Want mirrored m.2 boot disks (resilience)
- Want separate data drives (probably RAIDZ1 ZFS)
- New powerful CPU for power saving and a lot of power for a hungry VM (single core)

Budget around Â£1300

## MOBO

[ASUS Prime B760-PLUS D4](https://www.asus.com/uk/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b760-plus-d4/)

LGA 1700 socket - supports 12/13/14th Gen Intel

= DDR4
- 2.5 Gb ethernet
- 3 x m.2
- 4 x SATA


# CPU

My 1 year old desktop which uses:

Intel i5-13600K is 38,447 ($258)
KF = no onboard graphics

So I'll crank it up (as I need to guarantee speed)

Intel i7-14700 - multi is 43,735.. single is 4208. 8 Perf cores, 16 threads. 12 Effeciency cores, 12 threads.

## Summary

Customer service was brilliant. Got a technical person (Andy) on the phone who answered all questions and was super prompt at responding to emails. Didn't have to worry about server build as this is his job to advice.

I like the 2 year guarantee as well (labour and parts). Which I used beofre with an unstable 4790K.
