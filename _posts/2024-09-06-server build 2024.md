This is server being built by [https://www.quietpc.com/](https://www.quietpc.com/) as I need one fast and don't want to build it myself

Use case is

- Proxmox
- Want mirrored m.2 boot disks (resilience)
- Want separate data drives (probably RAIDZ1 ZFS)
- New powerful CPU for power saving and a lot of power for a hungry VM (single core)

Budget around £1300 (spent £1523 in the end)

## MOBO

[ASUS Prime B760-PLUS D4](https://www.asus.com/uk/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b760-plus-d4/)

LGA 1700 socket - supports 12/13/14th Gen Intel

- DDR4
- 2.5 Gb ethernet
- 3 x m.2
- 4 x SATA


# CPU

Intel i7-14700 - multi is 43,735.. single is 4208. 8 Perf cores, 16 threads. 12 Effeciency cores, 12 threads.

## Build and Delivery

Was exactly on time with great communication.

Packaging very good, and internal packing to stop movement.

Power on was exactly as expected going straight to bios

## Checks

- Is BIOS up to date? Should be 15th Aug 2024 update for Intel microcode 0x129 fix ie 1663. Yes it is.
- XMP is RAM running at full speed? It is 3200MHz. Seems like a low speed of the RAM - MOBO can handle more. 
- Need it to restart on power off
- Virtualisation on?

## Perf and Cooling?

[https://www.cgdirector.com/cinebench-r23-scores-updated-results/](https://www.cgdirector.com/cinebench-r23-scores-updated-results/) and compare with what it should be

## Run Proxmox





## Summary

Customer service was brilliant. Got a technical person (Andy) on the phone who answered all questions and was super prompt at responding to emails. Didn't have to worry about server build as this is his job to advice.

I like the 2 year guarantee as well (labour and parts). Which I used beofre with an unstable 4790K.
