There are 3 ways to send emails from a webserver via G Suite / Gmail:

1. SMTP - Less Secure, Port 587, pass GSuite username and password directly
2. API using Service Account - 2 step OAuth2. (not for Gmail)
3. API using 3 step OAuth2

This is significantly more complicated than using a provider such as [Postmark]() which is a simple API key.

## Why send email through GSuite/Gmail

I've been having problems with emails being quarantined / rejected sending through Postmark to academic institutions, who I imagine have strict inbound email policies. 

So I'm trying GSuite (and will try Office365 next) to see if emails get through.

I'm not sending a lot of email either - mostly user login confirmations, password resets.

[How not to get caught in email filters]() is where I discuss this problem from an email composition side.

## 1. SMTP

The easiest, not recommended, and least secure method.

I've already signed up for G Suite / Google Workspace for the domain osr4rightstools.org, and have a single email: dave@osr4rightstools.org. I'm using the cheaper `Google Workspace Business Starter` rather than the default `Google Workspace Business Standard`. Â£4.14 per month.

[https://admin.google.com/](https://admin.google.com/) Sign in with super administrator privileges for the domain eg osr4rightstools.org

[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/lesssecure.jpg "less")](/assets/2021-10-17/lesssecure.jpg)

Enable Less Secure setting for users.

[https://support.google.com/a/answer/6260879?hl=en-GB](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6260879?hl=en-GB) more information

[https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) Login to myccount and turn on Less Secure:


[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/lesssecure2.jpg "less")](/assets/2021-10-17/lesssecure2.jpg)

Turn on less secure.

Now

```cs
  var m = new MimeMessage();
var fromAddress = "dave@osr4rightstools.org";
  m.From.Add(new MailboxAddress("Dave Mateer", fromAddress));
  //m.To.Add(new MailboxAddress("Dave (Gmail)", toEmailAddress));
  // todo a to name?
  m.To.Add(MailboxAddress.Parse(toEmailAddress));

  m.Subject = osrEmail.Subject;

  var bodyBuilder = new BodyBuilder
  {
      HtmlBody = htmlBody,
      TextBody = textBody
  };

  m.Body = bodyBuilder.ToMessageBody();
  try
  {
      using var c = new SmtpClient();
      await c.ConnectAsync("smtp.gmail.com", 587);
      // Note: since we don't have an OAuth2 token, disable
      // the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism.
      c.AuthenticationMechanisms.Remove("XOAUTH2");

      await c.AuthenticateAsync("dave@osr4rightstools.org", gmailPassword);
      await c.SendAsync(m);
      await c.DisconnectAsync(true);

      return true;
  }
            

```



## Create a project in Google Cloud

[https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/dotnet](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/dotnet) .NET Quickstart for the Gmail API which links to:

[https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) create a new project in Google cloud platform:

[https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/project.jpg "prpoject")](/assets/2021-10-17/project.jpg)

project name: osr-email


## Enable Google Workspace API

Select project, Enable Apis and Services
Select Gmail API, Enable

## Create Credentials

[https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials)


### OAuth Consent screen

"When you use OAuth 2.0 for authorization, your app requests authorizations for one or more scopes of access from a Google Account. Google displays a consent screen to the user including a summary of your project and its policies and the requested scopes of access."

The above doesn't really make sense for us, as hopefully we'll just do this once for the `dave@hmsoftware.co.uk` user we want to send email from, and then it should alwyas remain active.

Internal - as I'm only going to be sending email from my single internal email - in this case `dave@hmsoftware.co.uk`


[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/consent.jpg "consent")](/assets/2021-10-17/consent.jpg)

I'm using my domain here - but will use the osr domain soon.

Don't need to put anything in Scopes.


### Create OAuth clientID credential

Credentials, Create Credentials, OAuth client ID

[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/oauth.jpg "oauth")](/assets/2021-10-17/oauth.jpg)

Application Type: Web

Authorised redirect URIs: https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc

[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/json.jpg "json")](/assets/2021-10-17/json.jpg)

Download the file `client_secret_7065.json`


## Create a new .NET Web Project

[GmailAPITest]() here is the source code for my test project

It is a .NET5 Razor Pages project with no Authentication turned on.

[![alt text](/assets/2021-10-17/json.jpg "json")](/assets/2021-10-17/json.jpg)

Solution running in Kestrel - select the GmailAPITest drop down (which may be IISExpress) to force Kestrel which gives nices debug informaiton which we'll use. You can see in `launchSettings.json` the default port of 5001 which we used above as the redirect.

Now lets import the NuGet packages

`Google.Apis.Gmail.v1` - v1.55.0.2356, 3.1M downloads, upadated 8th Sept 2021

[https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client) - this is the older Google API Dotnet Client library, not the newer idiomatic [https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet) Cloud Client libraries for DotNet which don't seem to include a Gmail API yet.

`Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore3` v1.55.0, 143K downloads, updated 8th Sept 2021 

There is a [https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/Src/Support/Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore3.IntegrationTests](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/Src/Support/Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore3.IntegrationTests) sample which uses Google Drive and Calendar APIs. But this includes code that walks us through the auth process.

**problem - this is logging the app in.. hmmm***











[https://www.emailarchitect.net/easendmail/ex/c/20.aspx](https://www.emailarchitect.net/easendmail/ex/c/20.aspx)

[https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/)

- Create project
- OAuth Consent screen
- Create credentials (OAuth client id) - web application, redirect uri: https://localhost:5001/foo

So I now have a ClientID and ClientSecret

- Enable Gmail API
- Edit scopes

But I need to workflow on my webapp ie the redirect uri

`Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore2` is a helper

The ASP.NET Core 3 Auth extension library contains a Google-specific OpenIdConnect auth handler.
Supports incremental auth, and an injectable IGoogleAuthProvider to supply Google credentials.

It uses MS OpenID Connect.

[https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth#configure-your-application-to-use-google.apis.auth.aspnetcore3](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth#configure-your-application-to-use-google.apis.auth.aspnetcore3) following these instructions

Here is a sample application:
[https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/Src/Support/Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore3.IntegrationTests](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/Src/Support/Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore3.IntegrationTests)



**HERE**

`Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore3`

did the google for Web Server Application, to get initial clientid and clientsecret

redirect URI is: https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc

signin-oicdc is important (it is hardcoded in the libraray and not one of my pages)

new Razor Pages project


`Google.Apis.Gmail.v1`


GoogleApiException: Google.Apis.Requests.RequestError
Request had insufficient authentication scopes. [403]
Errors [
Message[Insufficient Permission] Location[ - ] Reason[insufficientPermissions] Domain[global]
]

looking for labels

add scopes in OAuthConsent screen

okay I can see scopes of

email, profile, openid.. but no label

ah, I bet I have to refresh the token.

to check the access token:


[https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/tokeninfo?access_token=](https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/tokeninfo?access_token=)


So the access_token expires in 3600s which is 1 hour





[https://blog.elmah.io/how-to-send-emails-from-csharp-net-the-definitive-tutorial/](https://blog.elmah.io/how-to-send-emails-from-csharp-net-the-definitive-tutorial/)


[https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/dotnet](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/dotnet)

Create a Project and enable the API

Got a `client_secret_XXXXXXXXX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com.json` file

Downloaded quickstart app from [https://github.com/googleworkspace/dotnet-samples/blob/master/gmail/GmailQuickstart/GmailQuickstart.cs](https://github.com/googleworkspace/dotnet-samples/blob/master/gmail/GmailQuickstart/GmailQuickstart.cs)

Patched that into the app as `credentials.json` which allowed me to go through OAuth2 flow and get back

`Google.Apis.Auth.OAuth2.Responses.TokenResponse-user` - a file.

However this token will expire

I seem to need a 

ClientID
ClientSecret
