My thoughts are with the people who are on the front line, who are sick, and who have lost people to this pandemic.

I'm writing this article to:

- Help others with young kids who are working from home
- Help ourselves retain perspective and to cope with the bad days
- Gather data and make a decision on whether our kids should go back to school
- Try to take something positive away from this horrible situation

Scott Hanselman, developer, speaker and all round good guy who has kids, [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1252040170783641600?lang=en) on remote working during this time

It was good to know other people are finding times tough. It helped me.

## Data

I like to keep up to date with what is really happning and not just sensationlist news. In the UK I keep an eye on:

[coronavirus.data.gov.uk](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) has charts on what is acutally happening

## Don't Panic

> Don't Panic

[Arthur C Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic) said Douglas Adams' use of "don't panic" was perhaps the best advice that could be given to humanity.

Makes me smile.

## We are a working family

- My wife has an 80% job at the university as a lecturer in Conservation Biology
- I recently started my own company as a freelancer C# developer to develop my own SaaS products
- Daughter Mia is 5 and is in reception year at school
- Son Henry is 4 and was at nursery 4 days a week with my wife looking after him on a Friday.

We live in the South East of England in a small village with good access to the outdoors for walks / runs.

## Good Things

- Being outside with the kids more
- Learning about flowers and plants (Seek app) and teaching the kids how to identify plants

- Physically I feel better/more flexible as not sitting down for 8 hours per day
- Doing more running (2 year niggle foot injury getting better)

- watching films with the kids on the coach (and they love it when I'm there)
    - Shark Boy and Lava Girl (Netflix)

## Bad Things

- Me and the kids are much more moody

- Not having enough time to focus on job
- Not seeing friends

- Kids not socialising

## What we do

- During the week we split 50% work and 50% looking after the kids

- Go out for runs and record on Strava

- Go out for a walk before work

- Have lie ins at the weekend (alternate days)

- Meditate - Headspace app

- Don't worry about spending on: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Spotify... it keeps us happy

## Home office setup

We've got a spare room so have converted it into a home office by putting in 2 tables. Our internet is pretty solid (I've put in my own master switch) and the router is coming straight out of that. It is directly below the home office so WiFi is fine from that single router. I've turned off auto channel switching as some deves were not transitioning well (my iPhone 7). So have 2 networks now - HomeNetwork and HomeNetwork5 (with 5 being the 5Ghz shorter range highter throughput network.)  Most devices use the 2.4GHz as seems to be stable.

Our network is around 40Mbps (Mbits/s) down and 12Mbps up through plus.net. No fibre in our village. But we do have FTTC.

- Have an office door to close!
- We each have a desk in the office with screens and a desk ready to go.

- It looks quite nice with plants, and has good music (a good amp). Good webcam and speakers I like for now. I've gone off using headphones and a mic as a decent webcam has an okay mic these days.

## Observations

Some days suck! The kids drive me to breaking point. I start throwing things a bit. This is super unlike me, and I pride myself on being an ultra calm person. On some days, this lockdown, has pushed me very hard emotionally. just like the hardest times on expeditions.

Burn out quote from @shanselman

Getting outside helps with the kids.

When I work I

- do not look at social media
- do not look at emails
- focus on whatever task it is for 4 hours.

## Looking after others

I try and regulary keep in touch with loved ones.

## Looking after ourselves

Sometimes it is great just to sit in front of the TV and do nothing!

## Alcohol

Wine and beer is great, but it is very temping to drink loads. I'm generally happier not drinking usually and having some blow outs every now and again.

## Mood and coping with stuff

To some degree this is like being on expedition with big highs (well not many) and big lows (yes quite a lot).

- be kind to people (then wife cups of tea)
    - help people on twitter
    - help on so
    - talk to people / reach out
- be kind to yourself
    - read books
    - go running

## Post lockdown

It feels good to know and see other countries coming out of lockdown. The biggest things I'm looking forward to are:

- School going back
- Nursery going back

However this is a massive worry, as what about the health of our kids. I'm reading daily on current scientific thinking trying not to read sensationalist news.

eg

- Work from home a lot more

Its lookig

- Every day have time to run / be outside
- Pick up kids from school x days per week
- Have time to play with kids before and after school and weekends

- Not do too much (in terms of clubs for kids)
- Have time to do nothing with kids and myself

Have a free calendar is great!

- Don't spend so much on convenience food
    - its fun to cook own lunches
    - Bread cook
    - Omelettes
    - Eggy bread (see website fave receipes)

## Post Post lockdown

Next winter (flu season) may be difficult - so have to emotionally be ready.

## Conclusion

Good luck to us all in keeping safe and well - physically and emotionally.
