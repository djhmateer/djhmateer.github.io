UK Internet can take many weeks to switch on, so the ideal interim measure is to use a Personal hotspot on a mobile phone. Easy?! I think not.  

After moving a few times in the last year and now paying for my own mobile phone, this is what I now do:  

> Buy 4 SIM card for the 4 mobile networks at the supermarket for 99p each. Then test the actual coverage from my new house.

## Mobile Phone Networks

There are 4 physical phone networks in the UK. Others such as Tesco piggyback.

- EE (which are ex Orange, T-Mobile and Hutchison 3G)
- Three
- O2
- Vodaphone

## Deals

For me it didn't matter. All the areas I've lived in have had marginal coverage, so I bought the best plan availalbe for that network.  

[Three offer unlimited (1TB)](http://www.three.co.uk/Store/SIM/Plans_for_phones) are very exciting especially if you can get 5G.

## Tethering (personal hotspot)

I mistakenly thought using some old phones would be a good idea. They didn't get as good a signal as my new(ish) iPhone7. So the moral of the story is to use a new phone!
