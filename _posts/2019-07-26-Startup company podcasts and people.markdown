### Hiten Shah of FYI
[@hnshah](https://twitter.com/hnshah).  Very inspiring [podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/103-hiten-shah-of-fyi) and what resonated with me was the adventure, or choose your own adventure. Being a founder is not a career.

- Add value to the world
- Make proper money

Make sure the problems you are solving are your audience's top problems

Research  
 very important. Do this first (before any build)  
 customer needs  
 customer obsession  
find peoples problems online - easy to do this!  
competitor analysis  
reviews  

Then find the MVP and do creative solutions.
