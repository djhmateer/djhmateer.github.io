## Intro

In my series of exploration of LLM's / GPT, lets see if it can help me planning a ficticious Pressure Washer Rental business. 

This is really part 2

1. Coding / code completion / summerisation of code - html / css
2. Assimilating information and summerising  - coming up with project plan / marketing
3. Generation (text / image) - generating content / images
4. Coversation (chatbots)
5. Knowledge accessibility - question and answer

## Prompt Engineering

`ChatGPT, I want you to act as an expert business consultant with an IQ of 130. I'm planning to start a Pressure Washer Rental and Service business in Kingston near Lewes in East Sussex, England. I already know some of my competitors such as cleaningequipmentservices.uk. I need you to help me understand the market, identify key partners, and develop a marketing strategy. Then, we will define the business model, identify crucial assumptions, gather data, analyse the market and our competitors, and finall, construct a comprehensive business plan. Let's take this step by step, so we avoid making mistakes. Do you have any questions before we begin?`

Then I need to tell it about:

- scale
- services offered
- target customers
- startup budget
- physical vs online presence
- team and expertise
- duration ie when we want to start
