Migrating an [iPhone 7]() to a [Google Pixel 7a]()


- what if I lose a phone - all my MFAs will need to recover. This is a test.


## Migration

The iPhone ot Android migration was seamless using a cable. All contacts and applications are there.


## Apps

- LastPass - use master password (kept in physical safe place) and sms. Have also setup biometrics so can recover account if forget master password. With faceid and fingerprint.

- OneNote - use davemateerxps@outloo.com account and password

- WhatsApp - username and password

- Monzo - needs phone number, pin. Now biometrics too. They take a video and verify your identity.

## UI

- swipe up and hold - to see recently opened apps. same as double click


## eSim

Embedded sim. Don't see a good reason at the moment.
