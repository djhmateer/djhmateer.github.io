An SSH Key (public/private key pair) is the preferred way to connect to a Linux VM.  The benefits are:

- Don't need to remember a password
- More secure as can't brute force

[MS Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-ssh-keys-detailed#overview-of-ssh-and-keys)

```bash
az vm create --name davetest110 --resource-group rg --generate-ssh-keys

## connect to VM
ssh dave@davetest110.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

## connect to the VM ignoring initial do you trust prompt
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no dave@davetest110.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
```

I used the above to figure out the username `dave` to connect with. This is the username of the `WSL` user on my Windows machine.

## Files

when doing in WSL it writes to ~/.ssh/
  id_rsa.pub - the public key
  id_rsa - the private key
  known_hosts

when doing from Windows it does:

c:\users\djhma/.ssh/id_rsa
hmmmm generate ssh-keys didn't seem to work
   wrong key?
C:\Users\djhma\.ssh

## Connect from Windows

The above works fine connecting from WSL but I like to connect from Windows too.

## Connect from Multiple Machines to the VM

I use 3 machines to develop on on a regular basis:

- Work desktop machine
- Home laptop
- Home desktop machine

So do I share the public/private keys among these 3 machines to connect to my Azure Linux VM's?

## Manually Create SSH Keys

ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096

## Passphrases
asdf
