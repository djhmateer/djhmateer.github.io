[Cloudflare charges no markup on their domain registrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/about/). I've been very happy with [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com) over the years, but with a lot of domains it does add up, and I found I was being charged more and more as the number of domains added up.


can't do .co.uk domains currently
