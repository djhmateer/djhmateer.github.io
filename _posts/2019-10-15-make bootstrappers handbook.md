[Make - Bootstrappers Handbook](2019/10/15/Make-Bootstrappers-Handbook) by [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio), who launched products such as [remoteok](https://remoteok.io/) which lets you search for remote jobs, and [nomadlist](https://nomadlist.com/).

His book is a 'brain dump' and he is candid about his failures. His first piece of advice is:

> **Always Keep Shipping**

This seems to be a commonality amongst startup entrepreneurs - just do it and learn along the way, as getting stuff out there is massive.

## Idea

This section is about:

- Coming up with ideas
- Qualifying them

He suggests **solving your own problems** first and thinking small.

Also what are your **passions**.

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a good tool for this.

- What problem does it solve?
- Who does it solve it for?
- How easy to build/execute

## Build

I like to think about the headline of the product (Jeff Bezos - write the headline) to focus on building the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) which should work well.

"Broken link checker to make sure your website works and is professional! Look good in front of your clients when everything works"

"Full report with screenshots showing where all the broken links are"

- Be fast (1 month build Rule of Thumb)
- Focus on getting the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) working
- Technical - use what you know
- Minimalist design

Focus on a CTA (Call to Action) for the launch?

"Find any broken links in my website now"

Have a minimalist landing page

## Launch

## Grow

## Monetize

## Automate
