How can AI/AE help in the project management SDLC (Software Developemnet Lifecycle). Let's not overthink this too much as AI is just a tool.

- Who are the customers
- What are the benefits to them
- Will they pay for it?

## Strategy

Use claude-code and ChatGPT5

Use git on short lives feature branches for safety

Do this in small steps as the goal is performant, simple applications.

Be very careful about AI coding (as for example it prefers older packages)


## Research Phase

- Researcher
- Architect - standards and structure. (structure documents eg software principles - DRP, SRP.. hmmm)
- Product Manager - define the what. bit sized prds. inputs,outputs,edge cases.
- Engineer
- Tester

Including looking at alternatives

## Architect 

So I'm now looking at proof of concepts as I don't know the technology I want to use.

Is my preferred tech stack fit for purpose?

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Shadcn ui
- React Server Components - Prefer as much server side as possible
- Postgres
- biome - formatting (replaces prettier) and linting (improve code)
