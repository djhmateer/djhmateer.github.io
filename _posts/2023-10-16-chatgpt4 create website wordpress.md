## Intro

In my series of exploration of LLM's / GPT, lets see if it can help me create a Wordpress website for a new business.

I've done it very successfully with raw HTML and Tailwind CSS.

This is really part 1, 2 and 3 here. 

1. Coding / code completion / summerisation of code - html / css
2. Assimilating information and summerising  - coming up with project plan
3. Generation (text / image) - generating content / images
4. Coversation (chatbots)
5. Knowledge accessibility - question and answer 

I've got certbot/letsencrypt working for the cert on the reverse proxy for the proxmox server. Very easy.

## Automate build of Proxmox VM?

`what is a good way of scripting a VM build to put on proxmox?`

Apparently it is with the `qm` command

```bash
# ssh into my proxmox server from bash
ssh root@192.168.1.139

# show all the vm's (not containers)
qm list

qm start 107

qm reboot 107

# if a vm is not stopping properly.. ie vm is stuck. not graceful
qm reset 107
# not graceful
qm stop 107


# set start a boot to no
qm set --onboot 0 107

# info on the vm
qm config 120

qm set --memory 2048 107

qm config 120 | grep memory

# useful
qm stop 122

# destroy it
qm destroy 122

# HERE
# clone my template
qm clone 1002 122 --name hmsoftwareuk-p36

qm set --startup order=20

qm start 122

# ssh into the vm with dynamic IP address eg ssh 172.16.44.25
sudo bash -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlford/ubuntu-vm-boilerplate/master/run.sh)"

# Get MAC
qn config 122
# eg 9E:1B:66:61:F4:78

#pf sense -  Services / DHCP Server / LAN / Edit Static Mapping
# eg to 172.16.44.111

# allow ssh on port 36 or whatever
# so can easily get to it internally

# do a backup so can easily restore from this point?



```

q - qemu
m - manager

## 1.1 Starting from a blank slate

This to me seems like a great use case for programmers/entrepreneurs who just want to 

> Get started quickly to rapidly iterate on a project

## Idea and Why

Lets imagine that I want to explore the idea of 

> Running home brew training courses in real life

Why: 

- Because it is something I want to go on.
- Because it is a complicated hobby to get started with and there is always something more to learn
- Seeing others do something is a great way to learn
- You'll come away with wort to ferment of the different beers we will make
- Get away for a holiday / adventure
- Get the right kit a the right price
- Find top tips on suppliers of ingredients 
- Our favourite recipes 
- Will visit a commercial brewery
- Will visit home setups in the kitchen, outside and custom brew shed.

### Caveat.. and why not

*caveat - I'm not sure this is a good idea at all, but as an example, why not. And actually this is what LLM's are all about.. is moving fast, failing fast, so lets push this example and see what happens.*

`can you write an html website for running home brew training courses in person and online using tailwind CSS`

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/1.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/1.jpg)

this was a bit thin

## Add content and Generative AI Images

`add a login button on the top right`

`add more detail to the in person Intro to home brewing course including a summary of what will be learned and space for an image`

[https://www.bing.com/images/create](https://www.bing.com/images/create) - to create images from DALL-E 3

`create a beautiful image of home brewing equipment in an English kitchen`

`create a beautiful image of home brewing equipment in a brew shed with lots of equipment`


`add more detail to an intermediate home brewing course including a summary of what will be learned and space for an image`

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/2.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/2.jpg)

This is taking shape and exciting. Fast!


## Tag Line and Hero and CTA

`create a tag line for this site and put it in code`

`another tag line`


[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/3.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/3.jpg)


## Brewing Equipment


[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/4.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/4.jpg)

`make the image 100%`

Interestingly it has done better on the top section, which I could of course just use that code.

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/5.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/5.jpg)

I did use that code.

## Hamburger Menu

I gave it my code, but didn't work quite yet! Will have to delve into this, but need to keep going fast to do POC.

## Featured / Quotes / Footer

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/6.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/6.jpg)

Newspapers were all recommended

`could you put in a section on "as featured in" naming some prominent publications and newspapers in the UK`

`for the 'as featured in' section could you make up some ficticious beer websites that mention us, and give positive quotes on the excellent experience`

`please make up some quotes from fictitious people about how much they learned on home brewing`


`can you make this a hyperlink: <p>The Telegraph</p> with nice style`


## Conclusion

It took a day to put this concept together

- Great for brainstorming ideas
- Can put a 'product' in front of customers / stakeholders

Ultimately I'm not taking this idea forward because

- The numbers don't add up for the financial projections I want ie 5 people at Â£100 per day/month.
- Do I really want people in my house (doing crazy things with dangerous liquids)... they will.
- Do I want to the hasstle of organising people 

But I do want to brew with other people, and keep my hobby a hobby


## Next Project
go for wordpress as end user of the site may not be me.
