## Intro

In my series of exploration of LLM's / GPT, lets see if it can help me create a Wordpress website for a new business.

I've done it very successfully with raw HTML and Tailwind CSS.

This is really part 1, 2 and 3 here. 

1. Coding / code completion / summerisation of code - html / css
2. Assimilating information and summerising  - coming up with project plan
3. Generation (text / image) - generating content / images
4. Coversation (chatbots)
5. Knowledge accessibility - question and answer 

I've got certbot/letsencrypt working for the cert on the reverse proxy for the proxmox server. Very easy.

## Automate build of Proxmox VM?

`what is a good way of scripting a VM build to put on proxmox?`

Apparently it is with the `qm` command

```bash
# ssh into my proxmox server from bash
ssh root@192.168.1.139

# show all the vm's (not containers)
qm list

qm start 107

qm reboot 107

# if a vm is not stopping properly.. ie vm is stuck. not graceful
qm reset 107
# not graceful
qm stop 107


# set start a boot to no
qm set --onboot 0 107

# info on the vm
qm config 120

qm set --memory 2048 107

qm config 120 | grep memory

# useful
qm stop 122

# destroy it
qm destroy 122

# CLONE commands here
# clone my template
qm clone 1002 123 --name hmsoftwareuk-p37

qm set --startup order=20 123

qm start 123

# get dynamic IP address
pvesh get /nodes/pve/qemu/123/agent/network-get-interfaces --output-format=json | jq

# from an internal proxmov vm eg ssh pfsense (access point)
ssh 172.16.44.20

# ssh into the vm with dynamic IP address eg ssh 172.16.44.25
sudo bash -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlford/ubuntu-vm-boilerplate/master/run.sh)"

# Get MAC
qm config 123
# eg 92:61:B1:A5:5E:6A

#pf sense -  Services / DHCP Server / LAN / Edit Static Mapping
# eg to 172.16.44.111

# firewall, NAT
# allow ssh on port 36 or whatever

# sudo don't type 
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/147241/execute-sudo-without-password

# do a backup so can easily restore from this point?
vzdump 123

# easier to use the GUI?
qmrestore /var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-qemu-123-2023_10_17-11_40_41.vma 123

```

Patch through domain name from reverse proxy and put in certbot to ensure ssl is working.

So now I have a serer in proxmox ready for Wordpress.

```bash
# build the wordpress instance

# copy all files from /dev/chatgpt/wordpress/ to ~/source/
# infra should be in ~/source/infra

# run through the shell commands

```

So now we have a 

- working wordpress install
- ssl working via letsencrypt
- live on the internet hosted on proxmox

hmm not so good

`show me how to make a 1 page wordpress website using TailwindCSS`

try this - no.. ithttps://wordpress.org/plugins/tailpress/  [https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailpress/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailpress/)... 

**HERE***
lets just go simple and use the CDN version!!!





[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/1.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/1.jpg)

this was a bit thin

## Add content and Generative AI Images

`add a login button on the top right`

`add more detail to the in person Intro to home brewing course including a summary of what will be learned and space for an image`

[https://www.bing.com/images/create](https://www.bing.com/images/create) - to create images from DALL-E 3

`create a beautiful image of home brewing equipment in an English kitchen`

`create a beautiful image of home brewing equipment in a brew shed with lots of equipment`


`add more detail to an intermediate home brewing course including a summary of what will be learned and space for an image`

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/2.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/2.jpg)

This is taking shape and exciting. Fast!


## Tag Line and Hero and CTA

`create a tag line for this site and put it in code`

`another tag line`


[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/3.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/3.jpg)


## Brewing Equipment


[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/4.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/4.jpg)

`make the image 100%`

Interestingly it has done better on the top section, which I could of course just use that code.

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/5.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/5.jpg)

I did use that code.

## Hamburger Menu

I gave it my code, but didn't work quite yet! Will have to delve into this, but need to keep going fast to do POC.

## Featured / Quotes / Footer

[![alt text](/assets/2023-10-10/6.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-10-10/6.jpg)

Newspapers were all recommended

`could you put in a section on "as featured in" naming some prominent publications and newspapers in the UK`

`for the 'as featured in' section could you make up some ficticious beer websites that mention us, and give positive quotes on the excellent experience`

`please make up some quotes from fictitious people about how much they learned on home brewing`


`can you make this a hyperlink: <p>The Telegraph</p> with nice style`


## Conclusion

It took a day to put this concept together

- Great for brainstorming ideas
- Can put a 'product' in front of customers / stakeholders

Ultimately I'm not taking this idea forward because

- The numbers don't add up for the financial projections I want ie 5 people at Â£100 per day/month.
- Do I really want people in my house (doing crazy things with dangerous liquids)... they will.
- Do I want to the hasstle of organising people 

But I do want to brew with other people, and keep my hobby a hobby


## Next Project
go for wordpress as end user of the site may not be me.
