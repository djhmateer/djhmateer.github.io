I've been doing HTML for over 20 years now. I've got pretty interested in back end programming and enjoy it a lot. I've worked with some great designers, and have sort of kept up with some of the front end tech. 

I actively don't want nor need (I hope) a full SPA JS front end, so using frameworks like Vue, Angular or React.

As a SaaS business owner I to need to be able to create and modify

- Give confidence in the underlying product and company
- Make it easy to use
- Explore this beautiful world of front end tech, purely because I can!

## History

[HTML Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/html-fundamentals/table-of-contents) from Jun 2019 is a great beginners guide. I love going back to basics, so lets do it:

```html
<!-- most common DOCTYPE now. Which is HTML5. There used to by different standards eg strict -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- root element and should always include lang attribute to assist search engines and browsers-->
<html lang="en-GB">
<!-- head element contains document metadata -->
  <head>
    <!-- dont need closings tags on meta and link -->
    <!-- capable on encoding (thus rendering) all possible characters and displaying them -->
    <!-- good pracrice to keep this in -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do -->
    <!-- only if need to support IE8 or 9 -->
    <!-- or if using Bootstrap this will get rid of validation warnings -->
    <!-- https://github.com/twbs/bootlint -->
    <!-- need to be close to teh top-->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

    <!-- will display in browsers title bar at the top -->
    <title>Broken Link Checker</title>

    <!-- meta data on how to render this page viewport size is rendering window -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- used for twitter cards preview and search engines -->
    <meta name="description" content="A hello world sample">
    <meta name="author" content="Dave Mateer">
    <!-- keywords for search engines (not important anymore) -->
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">

    <!-- don't do this as it will block - put at bottom of body.. or not! see link below -->
    <!-- <script src="my-script.js"></script>
    <script>
        alert("Hello JavaScript!");
    </script> -->

    <!-- put into site.css! -->
    <!-- <style> 
       p {color:blue;}
    </style> -->

    <!-- linking another document -->
    <!-- recommended to omit the type="text/css" now -->
    <!-- styles are linked with CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">

    <!-- todo -->
    <!-- <link rel="canonical" href="https://davemateer.com/asdfasdf"> -->

    <!-- <base></base> -->

  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- text -->
    <h1>Wired Brain Coffee</h1>
    <h2>Coffee to keep your brain wired</h2>
    At Wired Brain Coffee, we believe that coffee can be the fule your active brain needs.

    <h4>Testimonials</h4>

    <!-- adding more information to the p element using the class attribute-->
    <p class="lead">Hello world!</p>

    <!-- class can use on many different elements on the same page-->
    <!-- but the id should be unique-->
    <p id="p1" name="p1n" class="lead">from Dave</p>


    <!-- lists -->


    <!-- links -->
    <a href=""></a>

    <!-- table -->


    <!-- images -->
  </body>
</html>

[Where should I put the script tag?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-should-i-put-script-tags-in-html-markup) - also see where [https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) are putting their scripts and other bits of head markup.

[https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) - current version on 26th Nov 2020 is 4.5.3   This is also good to look in the source to see where they put things. There is good commenting for opengraph for example.


Working with VS Code `Shift Alt F` to format the code.

## Displaying Text

a `<div>` is a general purpose block element we can use to identify a section of a page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Wired Brain Coffee</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="author" content="Matt Milner">
</head>

<body>
    <div id="article">
        <div id="header">
            <h1>Wired Brain Coffee</h1>
            <h2>Coffee to keep your brain wired</h2>
        </div>

        <div id="body">
            At Wired Brain Coffee, we believe that coffee can be the fule your active brain needs.

            <p>Coffee <span class="fact">has long been known</span> to provide a boost to brain activity and increase
                blood flow.</p>

            <p>Another dubious statement about coffee to try and sell it</p>

            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="footer">
        Copyright Dave Mateer 2020
    </div>

</body>

</html>
```

The fact class doesn't have anything applied to it yet. No bootstrap or any CSS yet, just using inbuilt style of the browser.


## Text Breaking and Sementic Meaning

I'm liking how this is set out, with the new HTML5 semantic tags. `<article> <header> <footer> <section>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Wired Brain Coffee</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="author" content="Matt Milner">
</head>

<body>
    <!-- <div id="article"> -->
    <article>
        <!-- <div id="header"> -->
        <header>
            <h1>Wired Brain Coffee</h1>
            <h2>Coffee to keep your brain wired</h2>
        </header>

        <!-- <div id="body"> -->
        <section id="body">
            At Wired Brain Coffee, we believe that coffee can be the fuel your active brain needs.

            <br />And we want you to believe it too.

            <p>Coffee <span class="fact">has long been known</span> to provide a boost to brain activity and
                increase&nbsp;blood flow.</p> And we want you to believe that too.

            <p>Another dubious statement about coffee to try and sell it</p>
        </section>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <hr />

        <blockquote><abbr title="Wired Brain">WB</abbr> coffee makes my brain feel like it is on fire
        </blockquote>
        <cite>Brenda &lt;Hoboken, NJ&gt;</cite>
        <p>
            <q>I'm <sup>productive</sup> when I drink this coffee</q>
            <cite>Jamal &lt;Chicago, IL&gt;</cite>
        </p>


    </article>

    <!-- <div id="footer"> -->
    <footer>
        &copy; Dave Mateer 2020
    </footer>

</body>

</html>

```

Use styleheets and borders instead of `<hr />`

Interesting html reference tags!

Bold, italics, font sizes will now be handled with a CSS.










### What is a good layout in 2020

  viewport?

SEO tags
ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers - 
Resize for different form factors

 Some my inspirations are:
 - totally simple! eg Apple, Google interfaces
 - google style forms where it tells you whare you are typing
 - when you press a button it changes state to signify something happening
 - not a JS framework (I generally don't need) eg React, Vue, Angular
 - some of the background videos are super impressive!
 - display lots of data (CRUD)

Let's use my canonical example which has
- Top Menu
- Footer
- Contact form
- Database data displaying

Under the hood it is a .NET5 Website
- Unit Testing
- Authentication and Authorisation
- Postgres

## File New Project Razor Pages in .NET5

Out of the box a new ASP.NET 5 Razor Pages Website uses:

- Bootstrap 4.3.1
- Jquery 3.5.1
- Jquery-validation 1.17.0 
- Jquery-validation-unobtrusive 3.2.11

Which are the same versions that were in ASP.NET Core 3.1 Razor Pages.

## Raw HTML!


## Bootstrap?

## Tag Helpers

[Tag Helpers - MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/anchor-tag-helper?view=aspnetcore-5.0). There are some useful ones, and ones which I don't like as they add complexity eg:

```html
<!-- asp-page is a tag helper Why???? -->
<a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-page="/Privacy">Privacy</a>

<!-- generated so I use this way Simpler! -->
<a class="nav-link text-dark" href="/Privacy">Privacy</a>

<!-- very useful to allow for smart caching -->
 <script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>

```

### RenderSection

A good placeholder for addding custom scripts, and the default Jquery validation helpers which use a CDN.

```html
<!-- _Layout.cshtml -->

<script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
<script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>

<!-- if there is any extra js eg jquery.validate.min.js on the login screen then load it here -->
@await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)

</body>
</html>
```

So this will inject in any scripts and we are using the [Environment Tag Helper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/environment-tag-helper?view=aspnetcore-5.0)

```html
<environment names="Development">
    <script src="~/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js"></script>
    <script src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script>
</environment>
<environment names="Staging,Production">
    <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.17.0/jquery.validate.min.js"
            asp-fallback-src="~/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.min.js"
            asp-fallback-test="window.jQuery && window.jQuery.validator"
            crossorigin="anonymous"
            integrity="sha384-rZfj/ogBloos6wzLGpPkkOr/gpkBNLZ6b6yLy4o+ok+t/SAKlL5mvXLr0OXNi1Hp">
    </script>
    <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validation.unobtrusive/3.2.9/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"
            asp-fallback-src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"
            asp-fallback-test="window.jQuery && window.jQuery.validator && window.jQuery.validator.unobtrusive"
            crossorigin="anonymous"
            integrity="sha384-ifv0TYDWxBHzvAk2Z0n8R434FL1Rlv/Av18DXE43N/1rvHyOG4izKst0f2iSLdds">
    </script>
</environment>

```
