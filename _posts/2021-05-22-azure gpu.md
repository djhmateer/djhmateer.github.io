I'm involved in a project which uses GPU's to do image detection.

It uses

- Python
- CUDA (so I need NVIDIA GPU Architecture)


## Charges

Status: 

- Stopped (deallocated) - this means it is not accruing charges
- Stopped - eg when you shutdown the VM from within the VM. It stays allocated and accrues
