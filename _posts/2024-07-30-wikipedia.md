Let's explore how easy it is to

- make an edit on wikipedia
- create a new page on wikipedia

Find out how they qualify

- truth / veractiy of information
- science that hasn't been discovered ie cutting edge

And how to deal with

- opinions

## What is Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_Wikipedia ) is a free encyclopedia, written collaboratively by the people who use it. Since 2001, it has grown rapidly to become the world's largest reference website, with 6.9 million articles in English attracting billions of views every month. For a more detailed account of the project, see About Wikipedia.

Founded on 5 principles

## Etymology

- content
- references
- images - free to use.
- talk page
- tagging eg [Manual Reverting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Reverting#Manual_reverting)



## Sign Up

Sign up with a username and email - I had to have a username like `DaveMateer`

Process was very easy, and in fact you can edit wikipedia just on IP address alone and don't need to sign up

## Edit a page

Unexpectedly it turned out to be very easy to do an edit on a page. The visual wysiwyg editor was pretty good, and there was a plain text editor there too.

[Edit that I did at 19:56](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rat-tailed_maggot&oldid=1237642615) - I had Graham sitting next to me saying what to write

I then 'subscribed to the page'.. but interestingly I didn't receive an email when the page was updated.


[Next edit at 20:13](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rat-tailed_maggot&oldid=1237645561) by Graham who is a world expert on hoverflies. It was very easy to get him started on editing.


[Next edit at 20:55 by an unknown person](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rat-tailed_maggot&oldid=1237653825) with the comment (not an improvement)

Well this is interesting. Lets see what they changed. The compare selected revisions tool was initially hard to see what changed

So it looks like the person [PlantDrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Plantdrew) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Plantdrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Plantdrew) has done 600k edits on wikipedia.

## Thoughts so far

- negative experience - trying to get my father in law to do edits, then have them reverted as 'not an improvement'

- annoying that 'PlantDrew' isn't a real name

- they are a plant expert, but are reverting changes from an expert entomologist with a comment 'not an improvement' which doesn't seem helpful for the entire edit. In fact doesn't make sense. Maybe it was the revert, so they were commenting on the previous edit.

- they have a section called 'Rant' on their profile - perhaps prickly person? 

todo

- dig deeper into how it all works and guidelines/principles
- what to do when you disagree with someones edits
- need to dig into how scientific the tone should be on articles.
- find out about tagging (ie)
