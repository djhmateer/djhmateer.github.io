[Appveyor]() is an automated build and test service which I used for several years. [Azure DevOps]() or AzDO is now a newer competitor.  

[https://www.davestopmusic.com/](https://www.davestopmusic.com/) is a legacy site using

- .NET 4.5
- Dapper
- SQL Azure
- Log4Net
- AutoMapper
- ASPNET Identity
- MiniProfiler

[Source is on GitHub](https://github.com/djhmateer/davesmusic) with a webhook into appveyor for any changes to master 

[Build is on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/djhmateer/davesmusic)  

I'm potentially moving the site off Azure.
