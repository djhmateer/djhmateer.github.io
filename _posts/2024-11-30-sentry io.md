[https://sentry.io/](https://sentry.io/) is for Application Monitoring of many languages.

- Error monitoring
- Tracing
- Profiling

[https://hmsoftware.sentry.io/](https://hmsoftware.sentry.io/) - nice they give subdomain

I've got a log files which I look at every day on 5 servers to see how my auto-archiver python application is doing


Onboarding is great and humour on the site too! 

## Issues and Events

[https://hmsoftware.sentry.io/projects/python/getting-started/](https://hmsoftware.sentry.io/projects/python/getting-started/) nice sample code.

```py
# Pipfile
# sentry-sdk = "*"
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://111111111111111.ingest.de.sentry.io/4508385977368656",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

division_by_zero = 1 / 0

```
`Issue` eg Division by Zero error has many `Events` eg 

UI auto update seems flakey. Need to do refresh to see real time events. Maybe good enough? 

Same exception in different function creates a new Issue - nice.

### try except



## Email Alerts

When a new high priority Issue is created it sends an email - nice



## Feedback

Only worked when ad-blocker was off


## Profiles

Can see the slowest functions

## Trace
asdf

## todo

logging - can I use this instead of logs do don't have to ssh to machines everyday
