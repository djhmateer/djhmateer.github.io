When coming to a legacy project, I've used the following techniques by [Simon Brown](https://simonbrown.je/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simonbrown) to:

- Initially document and explore a project
- Document the language used in the team and the history
- Document all the people involved
- Document where things are stored

[Techtribes Guidebook - example](https://leanpub.com/techtribesje) is a very useful example, and this is a free download.  

[Software Architecture for Developers - Volume 1](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers) and [Software Architecutre for Developers - Volume 2](https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture) are the 2 in depth books he has written.  

1. Introduction
2. Context
3. Functional Overview
4. Constraints
5. Principles
6. Software Architecture
7. Code
8. Data
9. Infrastructure Architecture
10. Deployment
11. Operation and Support
12. Development Environment
13. Decision Log
