Bots have found 3 of my low traffic sites and are continually posting to pages including [https://osr4rightstools.org/account/register](https://osr4rightstools.org/account/register)

<!-- [![alt text](/assets/2024-02-01/1.jpg "email"){:width="600px"}](/assets/2024-02-02/1.jpg) -->
[![alt text](/assets/2024-03-03/2.jpg "email"){:width="800px"}](/assets/2024-03-03/2.jpg)

I didn't mind until my email transport provider [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) blocked me due to spam compaints. The requests are all queued now as as shown above

Headless chrome from `92.205.163.226` which according to [https://ip-api.com/](https://ip-api.com/) is:

```json
{
    "query": "92.205.163.226",
    "continent": "Europe",
    "country": "France",
    "city": "Strasbourg",
    "org": "Host Europe GmbH",
    "as": "AS21499 Host Europe GmbH",
    "asname": "GODADDY-SXB",
    "mobile": false,
    "proxy": true,
    "hosting": false
}
```

So a Godaddy server doing Headless Chrome requests to my server. Not a real user!

However I believe the email is a real email (which was scraped from an American site). This type of action is the cause of my spam compaints.

Lets try some strategies

## 1. Honeypot hidden field

Just an extra html input box which is hidden via css. It will be blank for a human, but a bot will probably try to fill it in. 

```html
<div class="hidden">
    <input asp-for="Email2" class="input-text" value="">
</div>
```
and

```css
.hidden {
    display: none;
}
```

and some backend code:

```cs
if (Email2 == null)
{
    Log.Information("honeypot field not filled out - good!");
}
else
{
    Log.Warning("honeypot field has something in it - possible bot");
    ModelState.AddModelError("Password", "Are you a human?");
}

```

<!-- [![alt text](/assets/2024-03-03/4.jpg "email"){:width="800px"}](/assets/2024-03-03/4.jpg) -->
[![alt text](/assets/2024-03-03/4.jpg "email")](/assets/2024-03-03/4.jpg)

It did stop some requests like this one. You can see that my 'hidden' field called Email2

But not the HeadlessChrome above...

## 2. CAPTCHA

> Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart

I've now got rid of 99% of the junk that way coming in.


[![alt text](/assets/2024-03-03/6.jpg "email"){:width="700px"}](/assets/2024-03-03/6.jpg)

Some simple maths - yes lets see how long it takes for him to break this would be an example


## 3. Form Token

`ValidateAntiForgeryToken` should have worked below. Maybe the ones I saw had found a clever way around it.


## Appendix

Simple things to check!

### Check POST methods on pages

I'd forgotton to remove an OnPost method on a test contact page [https://arlawesi.org.uk/contact](https://arlawesi.org.uk/contact) - so lets close that loophole! And log whats happening to see if the trap has worked.

```cs
 public class ContactModel : PageModel
 {
     [HttpPost]
     [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
     public async Task<IActionResult> OnPost(string? email, string? message)
     {
         // was getting lots of spam posted to this unused method so lets log it
         // to make sure we're getting all of it
         Log.Warning($"email is {email}");
         Log.Warning($"message is {message}");
         return LocalRedirect("/email-fail");

         // email sending stuff here that was getting hit
     }
 }
```

### Newsletter Sign up / Contact Us form

[![alt text](/assets/2024-03-03/5.jpg "email"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2024-03-03/5.jpg)

[https://auto-archiver.com/](https://auto-archiver.com/) I don't get any interest from this form, so simplify by ditching out the Send, and leave my email on it.
