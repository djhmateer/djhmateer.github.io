[https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi) is a open-source solution for building and sharing document collections. Used by human rights and humanitarian organisations. [https://uwazi.io/](https://uwazi.io/). It can also be a public website

It is a flexibile systems where

- Entity (eg Leadership) has properties (eg Gender)
- Entity has primary documents and or supporting files (eg photo)
- Entity has have relationships to other Entities (eg State Entity - Ghana)

- Template describes an Entity (eg Gender - drop down, Tenure as UN Secretary-General - date, State - relationship)
- Thesauri - custom lists eg Gender - Male, Female, N/A
- Relationship Types - (eg Leadership is related to another Entity called State)


[https://demo.uwazi.io/](https://demo.uwazi.io/) is the screenshot demo above


## Dev version

update 5th Feb 24 - have given up using Dev as very slow to start up, and getting lock up errors when starting. My test environment on an ubuntu server is more reliable.

[https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi?tab=readme-ov-file#production](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi?tab=readme-ov-file#production)

Runs Docker for all dependencies.

I had to install on my bare metal WSL instance

Node using [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) then 

`nvm install 20`

yarn [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)

`npm install --global yarn` - 10.3.0


```bash
git clone https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi.git
cd uwazi

# docker spinning up Mongo, Redis, S3, Elasticsearch
./run start

# install - can take a while
# 437s (on v.fast desktop)
yarn install

# 1. careful this does a blank state
#yarn blank-state

# 2. if you've done a pull to update a current install

# 64 seconds
yarn migrate 
# 38 seconds
yarn reindex

# spin up dev environment 
# many minutes
# sometimes it totally locks ups needing a wsl --shutdown
# try again a few times and it generally works
yarn hot

# http://localhost:3000/
# u: admin
# p: change this password now

# webpack-server (ie don't need filewatch)
yarn webpack-server
```

Running application locally.

Terminal showing output of `yarn hot`

## Updating Problems

[![alt text](/assets/2024-01-30/4.jpg "email"){:width="900px"}](/assets/2024-01-30/4.jpg)

When updating the codebase I've had segfaults in the terminal which required a reboot. Also no errors, but terminals have all become unresponsive and can't restart a terminal. Full reboot required.

While waiting for yarn hot to start, I can't save from other processes in WSL. 

Perhaps for testing using the `production` branch may be more stable.

Perhaps try [production settings](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/blob/production/SELF_HOSTED_INSTRUCTIONS.md) if more stable.

```powershell
# open as admin
# takes 30 secs to shutdown
# sometimes need to do twice before it works
wsl --shutdown

```
> [nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

[![alt text](/assets/2024-01-30/5.jpg "email"){:width="900px"}](/assets/2024-01-30/5.jpg)

After doing a run start (is docker wasn't up) I tried to run.. and it locked up wsl. Tried again and it worked.

## Test and Prod

[https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issues/6423](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issues/6423) shows beginning of build script.

[https://uwazi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sysadmin-docs/index.html](https://uwazi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sysadmin-docs/index.html) Sys Admin guide


Run as a systemd service to survive a reboot

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system/
sudo vim uwazi.service

[Unit]
Description=uwazi backend service for your-instance
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment=DBHOST=localhost
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Environment=DATABASE_NAME=uwazi_development
Environment=ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
#Environment=INDEX_NAME=uwazi20
Environment=PORT=3000
Environment=UPLOADS_FOLDER=/home/dave/uwazi/uploaded_documents
Environment=LOGS_DIR=/home/dave/uwazi/log

WorkingDirectory=/home/dave/uwazi/latest
ExecStart=/home/dave/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/node server.js

Restart=always
RestartSec=30s
TimeoutSec=60s
User=dave

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

then

```bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable uwazi.service
sudo systemctl start uwazi.service
```

It should survive a reboot now.


## Migrating Data

As I've got multiple instances (including hosted where I've got no shell access), here is how I easily move the structure and data between instances:

- Thesauri - import

- Entity ()





## API Automation

I've been asked to integrate the [https://auto-archiver.com/](https://auto-archiver.com/) with Uwazi.  Essentially when a new link is archived, and when a tickbox is checked, then it should be automatically imported into Uwazi.

[https://github.com/huridocs/python_uwazi_API](https://github.com/huridocs/python_uwazi_API) is a handy wrapper to help in authentication and adding entities.

asdf



## Prod

[https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issues/6381](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issues/6381) is an open issue I've submitted about dependency versions of Mongo which stopped a bare metal install
