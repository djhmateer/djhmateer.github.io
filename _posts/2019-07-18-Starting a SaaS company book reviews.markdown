There are many books on startups, covering topics like

- Sales
- Product Development
- Marketing
- Entrepreneurship

Learning about any new domain I like to start with books, specifically so I can

> "...learn from the mistakes of others!"

## Goal
The goal of reviewing these books in this 'startup domain' is that I

- Want to start a software startup company (so I can make proper money in the long term for my family, have flexibility to enjoy my kids growing up and be there as a Dad, and because it looks like a lot of fun and a challenge!)  

- Do something in software as I really enjoy `Building Stuff` as opposed to infrastructure which I find more as `Configuring Stuff` 

- Want to be as smart as possible so as - not to burn out, not to lose our cash

- Want to become more social - love speaking at conferences, meeting people, and helping people

- Want to have a healthy lifestyle (which is not immediately synonymous with running a startup!)

- Help to inspire my kids to be entrepreneurial and to follow the path less travelled. Be all you can be, and live your dreams!
 
- Work with nice people (who I choose to work with)


To some degree this research phase of my company will all be about setting feasable goals, and deciding on strategies for

- Choosing what markets to target (how do you do that?)
- Choosing what style of products to build?
- How to tell if your product idea is a success

So my overall goal of book review phase is to: come up with a strategy on how to execute an idea.
