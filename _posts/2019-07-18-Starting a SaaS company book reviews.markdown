This is part of a series on [From Developer to Business Owner](/2019/06/20/From-Developer-to-Business-Owner-SaaS)

There are many books on startups, covering topics like

- Sales
- Product Development
- Marketing
- Entrepreneurship

Learning about any new domain I like to start with books, specifically so I can

> "...learn from the mistakes of others!"

## Goal
The goal of reviewing these books in this 'startup domain' is that I

- Want to start a software startup company (so I can make proper money in the long term for my family, have flexibility to enjoy my kids growing up and be there as a Dad, and because it looks like a lot of fun and a challenge!)  

- Do something in software as I really enjoy `Building Stuff` as opposed to infrastructure which I find more as `Configuring Stuff` 

- Want to be as smart as possible so as - not to burn out, not to lose our cash

- Want to become more social - love speaking at conferences, meeting people, and helping people

- Want to have a healthy lifestyle (which is not immediately synonymous with running a startup!)

- Help to inspire my kids to be entrepreneurial and to follow the path less travelled. Be all you can be, and live your dreams!
 
- Work with nice people (who I choose to work with)


To some degree this research phase of my company will all be about setting feasible goals, and deciding on strategies for

- Choosing what markets to target
- Choosing what style of products to build
- How to measure success

My overall goal of book review phase is to: come up with a strategy on how to execute an idea.

## How to do a book review
[Writer Center - how to do a book review](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/book-reviews/)

> Above all, a review makes an argument.
> .. it is a commentary, not merely a summary

I'll aim to put the books in my favourite order

## Zero to One - Peter Thiel
My commentary: Be disruptive, be optimistic!, get a monopoly, do something good, monopolise, and the great Dylan quote of "He who is not busy being born is busy dying". This book didn't speak to me as a soon to be standup founder, but it did expound so common traits of successful founders.

- Notes on Startups, or How to Build The Future

Disruptive innovation (not to be iterative)

Be contrary! Think for yourself.  

> All happy companies are different - each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem.
> All failed companies are the same - they failed to escape the competition
 

5. Last Mover Advantage
Start small and *monopolise*
 Focus on a nice group eg ebay power sellers, and get that market

6. You are not a lottery ticket
Optimism
Do something good

7. Follow the Money
idea must have potential to succeed at a vast scale
focus relentlessly on *something you are good at*

9. Foundations
remote working hard for a startup
low CEO pay
> He (who is) not busy being born is busy dying.. Bob Dylan

10. Mechanics of Mafia
Have a mission statement eg
> Make the web a better place

11. If you build it will they come?
10% daily growth
viral marketing

12. Man and Machine
Hybrid of AI and people 
eg palantir - detect anomalies in data - terrorism fraud etc..

13. Seeing Green
7 business goals
- Engineering
- Timing
- Monopoly
- People
- Distribution
- Durability
- Secret

14. Founders Paradox
Never underestimate your own power


## This is Marketing - Seth Godin
I found this book disappointing as it didn't get into enough detail. The last page of marketing worksheet was good.
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Marketing-Cant-Until-Learn/dp/0241370140/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=this+is+marketing&qid=1563530627&s=gateway&sr=8-1">

I liked the simple marketing worksheet at the back of the book:
- Who's it for?
- What's it for?
- What is the worldview of the audience you're seeking to reach?
- What are they afraid of?
- What story will you tell? Is it true?
- What change are you seeking to make?
- How will it change their status?
- How will you reach the early adopters?
- Why will they tell their friends?
- What will they tell their friends?
- What asset are you building?
- Are you proud of it?

I liked the ideas on:

Always be testing
Scrapbooking ie Typeface, price, offers, images, interface.. of other products
and to be irresistable

To spend a lot of time on your audience, understand their needs

## Growing a Productized Service (ManyPixels)
[Free book written in 24hours](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-br9CMwTZP9Dk_vN6z51PgbdI848k0RJsiZholXwuj4/mobilebasic)

[https://www.manypixels.co/](https://www.manypixels.co/) employs designers then charges customers a monthly fee for unlimited services.  Pay a fixed monthly price and get designs back in 1-2 days (or more for web work). He has 20 designers around the world working for him. Essentially he has **productized or scaled a service business**

### Finding an Oppportunity
Talk to customers or find out online **what customers are complaining about**:

- Quora
- Online forums
- Nice facebook groups
- Twitter
- StackExchange network?


In the case of ManyPixels I realised myself and other customers had the following problems when ordering design services:

- Lack of transparency (designers charged different prices every time)
- Poor experience (creating a job offer and reviewing candidates was annoying and took time, multiple candidates bailed too)
- Poor communication (creating briefs was difficult, and the designers did not always understand briefs)
- Unreliable workforce (as a business with projects, I wanted to make sure the freelancers would be reliable and continue the work)
- Lack of trust (paying upfront freelance graphic designers)

Solution :

- Fixed fee (no more proposals, no more back and forth)
- On-demand workforce (tap a button, and get your design done work - no more job offers, no more reviewing of candidates)
- Streamlined communication (beautiful forms to submit your design briefs, and a platform to communicate with the designers and manage all your files)
- Insurance (Money back guarantee)

It becomes easier to craft a solution once you know each pain point customers are experiencing.

### Conclusion
- Find product/market fit: Talk to your customers
- Building a marketing machine: Talk to your customers, run experiments, be data-driven (not too much at the beginning)
- Focus on hiring great people: Keep your structure simple, do not put too many processes in place
- Delegate and automate: Use tools to automate, get an internal wiki to delegate task
- Grow yourself as a leader: Focus on your leadership, get an executive coach, be aligned with co-founders
