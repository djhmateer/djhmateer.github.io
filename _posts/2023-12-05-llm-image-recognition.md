Summary so far for AI


1. Coding / technical - ChatGPT4 is my go to. For technical problems I use an LLM first, Google second. eg how do I install Wordpress on Linux
2. Assimilating information and summerising  - I was sent an NDA to sign. Paste it into an LLM and it is invaluable.
3. Generation (text / image) - generating content / images - great for demo websites
4. Coversation (chatbots) - good for kids to explore with
5. Knowledge accessibility 

6. Images - see below


Image Analysis

Image Description into English

Image 


## Describe an Image

I'm working in human rights investigations. To mitigate trauma for myself and other investigators, I want the AI to descibe in non emotional terms what is in the image.

`could you give a general description of this image please. Also identify objects, people, scenes. Can you also tell me if this would be classified as a traumatic picture for someone to look at`


### Simple Description in 5 words
`describe this image in 5 words`

### Traumatic Rating

`give traumatic rating on a scale of 1 - 5`



Even these 2 very simple queries are super useful. 


## Which LLMs are good?

ChatGPT4 looks good, but will be expensive. Lets find out if there are any other more suited models

ideally I wwant to run these models myself via an API
 as have 10's thousands

## FOO

Where is this image taken - exif data, reverse image lookup



## Videos

I tried a sample aa005 mp4 video and it failed to analyse it.
