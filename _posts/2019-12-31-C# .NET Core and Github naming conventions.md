I use Windows and Linux (which is case sensitive), so have altered my preferred naming conventions:

## GitHub / BitBucket etc

`brokenlink` - most favoured
`broken-link-checker`

[GitHub use hypens](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947816/26086) and repositories like [Microsoft dotnet samples](https://github.com/dotnet/samples) favour lower case, and single words.

## Bash files

I have an `infra` folder in my repositories for infrastructure building. Inside I have `infra.sh` and `db.sh` bash scrips. Lower case for all makes it easier to type!

## Solution and Project
