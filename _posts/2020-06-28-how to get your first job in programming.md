So as an ~~experienced~~ old programmer I've been asked a few times:

> "How do I get started in programming"

I've gone from being a geek when I was 8 years old to about 16 playing computer games and messing with my Dad's [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) then getting a [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum),  [Amstrad PC1512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC1512), old BBS's with 1200/2400 etc.. baud modem.

Then I got into engineering / rock climbing / travelling / being an outdoor instructor and didn't do technology for a long time.

When I was about 29 I 'got my foot in the door' with a friend of the family's company. I was a junior and learned all about TCP/IP networking, Sun Solaris, Novell Netware, IT Support, RedHat Linux, Apache, PHP (building from source). I did mostly IT support and got my first taste of programming with PHP3.

So to highlight - the important part here was **getting an initial job doing something to do with computers**. After that it has been easy to change within the industry. For me it has gone from IT towards programming.

## Do you enjoy messing around with computers

This may seem a strange first title, but do you actually like computers (I guess you probably do as you're reading this post), or are you after a job in programming just for the money (unusual but I've seen it).

Think about what you enjoy, so you can tell others about it:

- What stories do you have
- Building your own machines -  CPU's / Graphics cards?
- Messed around with HTML / CSS / Javascript / Python

## Soft Skills - It's about people

- Communication - can you talk to people?
- Technical skills can be taught/picked up by someone who is interested

## Are you a good person

These are the kinds of questions going through a potential employers mind as they talk to you, so try to set their minds at ease:

- Will you turn up on time at work?
- Will you be a good person to work with / can talk to other people (I got an engineering job once I wasn't suited for by telling bad jokes, and I think people liked it as it showed I can at least talk to people, and they hoped I would pick up the engineering)

## Are you reasonably presentable and clean

- Showering is important
- Deodorant
- Good haircut
- Lay off the garlic / booze sessions for a while...

## CV / Resume

- [Something short is good](https://hmemcpy.com/cv.pdf)
- What about a resume website on Github Pages? [Themeforest CV/Resume Templates](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/specialty-pages?sort=date&tags=resume,cv&term=resume#content) and [this one](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/porto-responsive-html5-template/full_screen_preview/4106987?_ga=2.48266853.2118312912.1568632778-1690105632.1568283525) seem interesting

## Go to local user groups

- This is a wonderful way to meet people and get your foot in the door. [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) is a good place to search for local groups.

## Hard Skills

I've not talked about hard skills yet which may seem surprising, however so much is a about what I've talked about above and if you have a passion to learn then your current hard skills I'd say are less important.

My most memorable interview was when the candidate said:

> "I've got a demo a project I'm working on in my spare time, and I've bought it along on my laptop. Want to see it?"

He got the job!

So having fun side projects shows you have passion for something.

## Fun programming challenges

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a wonderful set of programming challenges. When I'm learning a new language I often go back to the first question and start again. Or if I'm trying a [new style of programming](/2018/09/20/Improve-Programming-using-Project-Euler)

[https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) is a interesting place to hang out too.

## Do you use GitHub

Being able to use Git is a super important skill these days.

GitHub is now free for private repositories (for less than 5 contributors).

- Is there a project on your own Github you can talk about that you're excited about?

## Do you have Stack Overflow account

Answering others questions is a wonderful challenge

## Twitter

- Follow people in your local area that look interesting
- Follow industry leaders eg [@shanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) in C#, [@troyhunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt) in security, [@ploeh](https://twitter.com/ploeh) for functional programming, [@nick_craver](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver) for SO, [@stevejgordon](https://twitter.com/stevejgordon) for C#, [@mikehadlow](https://twitter.com/mikehadlow) for C#, [@richcampbell](https://twitter.com/richcampbell) and [@carlfranklin](https://twitter.com/carlfranklin) dotnetrocks [podcast](https://dotnetrocks.com/).

- Ask politely for others to help in getting your first job eg look at these conversations:

## LinkedIn

This could be a good resource and always worth trying. [I'm here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-mateer-6274942/) if I can help.

## Resources

- Get good at googling!
- [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) written 20 years ago and still very relevant!

Here is my cheeky son wishing you good luck on your adventures in programming!
