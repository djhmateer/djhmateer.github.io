[Homelab Web Sever](/2022/01/12/home-web-server) is my previous article on setting up networking and a bare metal Ubuntu Server for hosting a website from my home.

In this article I am going to use virtualisation to let me run many virtual machines on the single bare metal server. To do this I am going to use:

[Proxmox VE - Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) is an open source server management platform for virtualisation which integrates the [KVM - Kernel Virtual Machine](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) Hypervisor.

[VMWare ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/esxi-and-esx.html) is an alternative to Proxmox VE

## Why Run a Homelab?

I want to run

- Self hosted Wordpress for a low traffic site (Apache, PHP, MySQL)
- Python test environments to see what dependencies I need
- Potentially the home Plesk server
- Learn about Ansible

[https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) - other great ideas for home server projects

[https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) - discussion on home server / self hosted

Update 29th July 2022 - I've been running Proxmox now for 6 months. It has been very stable running

- a wordpress website [hoverflylagoons.co.uk](https://hoverflylagoons.co.uk)
- an API for hatespeech detection  [https://osr4rightstools.org/](https://osr4rightstools.org/)
- auto archivers for [https://osr4rightstools.org/auto-archiver](https://osr4rightstools.org/auto-archiver)

I'm using Pfsense as the firewall and NAT and nginx as a reverse proxy. There is a network diagram a the end of the article.


## Install Proxmox - Part 1

I'm following along the excellent tutorials from which I'm updating (14th Jan 2022) [https://www.dlford.io/how-to-home-lab-part-1/](https://www.dlford.io/how-to-home-lab-part-1/)

[https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve) Version: 7.1-2

Update 29th July 2022 - there is a new updater, but a friend used it and found display issues. So went back to 7.1-2 and it worked!

I used [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a boot USB.

## Network setup

FQDN: `pve.dave.home`

[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29917860](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29917860) according to this a better name may be `pve.home.arpa`. Or just register a real domain name to make sure it wont conflict.

PVE is Proxmox Virtual Environment

My home subnet from DHCP on the router is: `192.168.1.0/24` ie subnet mask `255.255.255.0` ie 24 bits are used.

The DHCP range is `192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.253`

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/static.jpg "static")](/assets/2022-01-13/static.jpg)

I've assigned pve to be on 192.168.1.139 and forced the DHCP table to not assign it to anything else - it is a static IP address now.

## Web

[https://192.168.1.139:8006/](https://192.168.1.139:8006/) - PVE Web interface

u: root

Here we are setting up the updates for PVE:

```bash
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
mv pve-enterprise.list pve-enterprise.list.disabled
# careful of debian version
# Proxmox 7 (7th Dec 2021) runs on Bullseye (Debian 11.2, 18th Dec 2021)
echo 'deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription' > pve-community.list
# version 6
echo 'deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription' > pve-community.list
apt update
apt -y dist-upgrade
```

- Proxmox 7 (7th Dec 2021) runs on Bullseye (Debian 11.2, 18th Dec 2021)
- Proxmox 6 runs on Buster (Debian 10)
- Proxmox 5 runs on Stretch (Debian 9 LTS until June 2022)

Proxmox version 5 instead of 6, change “buster” to “stretch” in line three. These are version names for Debian releases, Proxmox versions 5 and 6 run on Debian Stretch and Buster respectively.

## Secure Boot Problem

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/boot.jpg "secure boot"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2022-01-13/boot.jpg)

After rebooting from updated above I got a Secure Boot Violation warning from my BIOS

The solution was to go into the BIOS - Boot, then change the order of the boot devices to be the M2 drive and not the UEFI boot loader device.

## Create a VM

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/upload.jpg "upload")](/assets/2022-01-13/upload.jpg)

Upload ISO from workstation

Create VM:

- Name: webserver-test
- OS: Ubuntu (just uploaded)
- Disks: 32GB (Default)
- CPU: 1 Socket, 2 Cores
- Memory: 2048MB (Default)


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg "start")](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg)

Start it

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg "start")](/assets/2022-01-13/start.jpg)

It works! However

Got a DHCP address of: 192.168.1.140/24 which is an address gives from the routers DHCP server.

Something which is annoying here is I can't see the allocated DHCP address on this summary page. I need a guest agent installed - see below `qemu-guest-agent`

My routers summary page below is fickle too ie displays incomplete information


Ubuntu server install

- server name: webserver-test-ubuntu
- u: dave

put on SSH Server so I can connect from WSL2 on my workstation:

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/ssh.jpg "ssh")](/assets/2022-01-13/ssh.jpg)

After the Ubuntu server installtion completes (a few minutes), and a reboot, I could access the VM

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/wired.jpg "wired routes")](/assets/2022-01-13/wired routes.jpg)

Interesting information from my router, but not to be trusted. It does get confused. See below when I go to pfSense for DHCP and networking.

```bash
ssh 192.168.1.140
# internal DNS works as the router is handling it
ssh webserver-test-ubuntu
```

Can see the pve hypervisor on .139, and the newly created VM with it's correct linux servername I gave above when I named the server (not in pve).

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```

## Updates - Part 2

[https://www.dlford.io/managing-proxmox-how-to-home-lab-part-2/#software-updates](https://www.dlford.io/managing-proxmox-how-to-home-lab-part-2/#software-updates)

For software updates maybe do every week.

For PVE version updates - follow the advice above. Maybe log into the server directly rather than the web interface.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/update.jpg "update pve")](/assets/2022-01-13/update.jpg)

Reboot PVE if Kernel update.

After a full shutdown and restart the following day, pfSense did not auto start up. I tried to replicate but perhaps after a proxmox update it needs a full shutdown / startup test.

```bash
# stay on top of VM updates
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade 
```

Upgrading the distribution of a linked clone - lets find out how this affects new instances of a linked clone.

## Mount an external USB drive (don't do this for backup disk) 

[https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/how-to-add-hard-drive-to-host.119376/](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/how-to-add-hard-drive-to-host.119376/) - don't do this!

Plug it into the usb device and restart proxmox!

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/100.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/100.jpg)

Can see my eternal disk 2TB Elements (note it is formatted with ntfs)

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/101.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/101.jpg)

I had strange issues where the disk disappeared, so trying an exfat disk instead.

ChatGPT `why does my usb disk disappear from proxmox`

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/102.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/102.jpg)

`dmseg` log output from the shell showing the disk.

Wipe Disk, Initialize with GPT


But do I want a snapshot or backup?

Disks, LVM-Thin, select correct Disk eg `/dev/sda`, Create - this took 10 minutes on a 2TB usb disk.


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/103.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/103.jpg)

Disk is not LVM (thin)

And accessible as pmback.

## Mount USB external drive as backup disk

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZjMxdBPH7M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZjMxdBPH7M) hmm it didn't work.. lets try this video

`/dev/sda/`

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/105.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/105.jpg)

`lsusb` to see if usb 2 or 3. Just to make sure am connected to the right hub


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/106.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/106.jpg)

`fidisk -l` - to see what disks are formatted as.

5:45 
`mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda` - is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem here!

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/109.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/109.jpg)

`blkid -o list` - gets uuid


`mkdir /mnt/usb-drive`

`ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/*` - list devices by uuid. So that if we plug in other usb drives and gthey can assigned to /dev/sda then it would get a failure on mount if it is sdb etc..

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/107.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/107.jpg)

`vim /etc/fstab`

Add in `/dev/disk/by-uuid/ab6e004f-6c99-4d33-b145-4208201c404e /mnt/usb-drive ext4 defaults 0`

`df -h` - it is not there yet

`mount -a` - run fstab

`df -h`

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/110.jpg "dist upgrade")](/assets/2022-01-13/110.jpg)

It is there!

Every one of my VM's being backed up to the usb drive.


## Snapshots VS Backups

Backups - complete representation of VM.

Snapshot - representation of VM's state.

Use a snapshot if you're doing a risky upgrade and may want to roll back a VM. Otherwise use a backup.

You can run a backup of a VM that is running.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/backup.jpg "backup")](/assets/2022-01-13/backup.jpg)

Took 1 minute (on SSD) at 2GB in disk space.

### Restore

Make sure the origianl VM is stopped. Then can restore it.

Restore from above took 7 minutes.

## Restore to a new VM

Local (pve) > Backups > Restore

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/restorenew.jpg "restore new")](/assets/2022-01-13/restore new.jpg)

Check the Unique box to generate a new unique values eg MAC address

This took 32 seconds to create a new VM

The new VM started with the same name Proxmox and the unix name was the same. Confusing.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/edit.jpg "edit")](/assets/2022-01-13/edit.jpg)

Rename VM in Proxmox.

To change the hostname in Ubuntu:

```bash

# display current hostname
hostnamectl

# change hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newNameHere

# updates hosts file
sudo vim /etc/hosts

sudo reboot now
```

This works, but I'm sure there is a better way (Linked Clone) to easily spin up pre-built machine.

### Schedule backups

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/backup2.jpg "backup2")](/assets/2022-01-13/backup2.jpg)

Selecting Schedule ~~2 am here~~ I have a typo, Schedule should be: 02:00 and VM's to backup. Next tab gives retention for days, weeks, months, years.

## Intranet Site with pfSense - Part 3

[https://www.dlford.io/pfsense-nat-how-to-home-lab-part-3/](https://www.dlford.io/pfsense-nat-how-to-home-lab-part-3/) Intranet Site pfSense

> Proxmox provides some really great firewall features, unfortunately they don’t offer the configuration options we need for DHCP, DNS, and NAT, so we’ll be using pfSense to handle all of those.

But do I need this firewall if I want to host some websites?

Yes.. want the homelab to be as secure as possible. The firewall allows me to segreate my home network from the 'prod' which is called 'LAN' network.

**TODO** put in network diagram here

He is heading towards the modem in bridge mode so pfSense gets a public IP from the ISP. Bridge mode disables firewalling on the modem. I'm still using my modems firewall and port forwarding 80 and 443 to the firewall.

Everything else is connected to the pfSense box cia a VLAN aware switch. Separate VLAN networks in pfSense for lab, IOT, workstations.

[https://www.pfsense.org/download/](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) AMD64 and ISO. I'm using pfsense 2.5.2

WAN IP is 192.168.1.144/24

I couldn't connect to the web interface from my workstation. Tried taking off the LAN network and just having the WAN on 192.168.1.144. I had to full reboot pfSense and then it worked!

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/wan.jpg "wan")](/assets/2022-01-13/wan.jpg)

I'm going to force pfSense to use 192.168.1.50 which is outside of the DHCP range of my router/modem.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/lan.jpg "lan")](/assets/2022-01-13/lan.jpg)

Lan on `172.16.44.1`

My plusnet router didn't like me assigning a static IP address when DHCP is turned on.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/static2.jpg "static2")](/assets/2022-01-13/static2.jpg)

The way to get it working was to allow pfSense to get a DHCP address from the router, then force the router's DHCP to always assign that IP address to pfSense (just like setting up PVE at the top of this article 1st screenshot)

Essentially I've 2 static IP's on my 'internal' network now:

- 192.168.1.139 - pve
- 192.168.1.144 - pfSense

In the screenshot I've logged in from my workstation which is on 192.168.1.105 which is assinged a DHCP address from the plusnet router. I've since made that a static IP on the modem.

## Firewall

Lets try and get access from my local network only to pfSense

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/fire.jpg "fire")](/assets/2022-01-13/fire.jpg)

I was locked out after this change. I had to do `pfctl -d` again.

## Template Server VM

`qemu-guest-agent` need to install this agent on all VM's running under Proxmox

- Convert VM to Template

When clone the template to a new VM you get to skip all the confiuration

Another option is to

- Use a template without actuall converting it to a tempalte

Can't create a linked clone

But can make changes and install updates on teh template since clones aren't linked

### Linked Clones

Save disk space as base OS not copied to the clone

To create a linked clone:

Create VM

- General
	-	VM ID: 1001 (keep templates at the bottom  of the VM list)
	- Name: Ubuntu-20.03.3-20220117
- Disk:
  - 8GB
	- Discard checked (will free up space from files deleted on vm)
- CPU:
   - Cores: 2
- Memory:
   - 512MB
- Network:
	 - Bridge: vmbr1 (the private VM internal server network)

Start the VM

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/error.jpg "error")](/assets/2022-01-13/error.jpg)

Hmm - didn't work! Try giving it 1GB of RAM. Yes this worked - using 879MB during install.


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/dhcp.jpg "dhcp")](/assets/2022-01-13/dhcp.jpg)

Next thing is my internal network isn't working ie not getting assigned a DHCP address.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/lan2.jpg "lan2")](/assets/2022-01-13/lan2.jpg)

So this worked and I've got an internal address now. I updated the installer

Install the OS
 - Use an entire disk and set up LVM

machine name: red

user: dave

password:

Didn't install SSH as I usually do

Proxmox: Hardware, CD/DVD, Do not use media

Then press enter in ubuntu console as have removed installation hardware.

```bash
sudo apt update
# Apt-get dist-upgrade has a smart conflict resolution system, so it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages, at the expense of those deemed less important
sudo apt dist-upgrade

# helps the Proxmox host communicate with the VM guest 
sudo apt install -y qemu-guest-agent
```

[dist-upgrade link](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-apt-get-upgrade-apt-get-dist-upgrade-and-do-release-upgrade/#:~:text=Apt%2Dget%20dist%2Dupgrade%20has,remove%20packages%2C%20it%20only%20upgrades.)


Agent:

- shutdown command on Proxmox itself will result in cleaner shutdown on the vm

Shutdown the VM

Tick both boxes.

Click on name on VM, Convery to Template

## Create Web Server VM

Options > Start at boot yes, Start/Shutdown order: 20 (so will start after pfSense)

Hardware, Network. Copy MAC Address - need it later to set up a DHCP reservation.

start the VM

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/nginx.jpg "nginx")](/assets/2022-01-13/nginx.jpg)

The agent is working as I can see a good LAN address! We will change this below to be a static IP reservation.

## Boilerplate

Anytime you clone a VM, run the following commands to ensure uniqueness:

So this was tricky as couldn't copy and paste. I ended up doing a NAT Rule so I could SSH into the box.

An easier way is to do

```bash
# I forgot to do this in my template
# run from pve console
sudo apt install openssh-server

# setup port forward rule (screeshot below) for SSH so can copy and paste

```

Create a linked rule for NAT and Firewall.

- Firewall > NAT > Port Forward

**note below I'm now using 192.168.1.0/24 instead of 192.168.1.105 as my desktop has a non static IP.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/for27.jpg "forward 27")](/assets/2022-01-13/for 27.jpg)

This creates a linked WAN Firewall rule.


```bash

# run boilerplate
# https://www.dlford.io/secure-ssh-access-how-to-home-lab-part-5/#boilerplate
sudo bash -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlford/ubuntu-vm-boilerplate/master/run.sh)"

# STOP the above command does all below

# to run sudo as interactive session
sudo -i

rm -f /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
rm -f /etc/machine-id
dbus-uuidgen --ensure=/etc/machine-id
ln -s /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/

ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N '' -t rsa -y
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key -N '' -t dsa -y
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key -N '' -t ecdsa -b 521 -y

sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled

# red was the name of my template vm
# **CHANGE red/xxxx to red/name of new machine**
sed -i 's/red/hmsoftwareorg/g' /etc/hosts
sed -i 's/red/hmsoftwareorg/g' /etc/hostname

# set new hostname to nginx
hostnamectl set-hostname hmsoftwareorg

sudo reboot
```

After a reboot I got another DHCP allocation `172.16.44.12`, so can't connect anymore. 

## DHCP Reservation

pfsense, Services, DHCP Server, Edit Static mapping (at bottom)

Reserving `172.16.44.101` for this mac address on ie the nginx server.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade

sudo reboot

sudo apt install nginx
```

[https://github.com/djhmateer/proxmox](https://github.com/djhmateer/proxmox) is where I keep my nginx sites-available conf file.

## Create Port Forward

We're aiming for a reverse proxy, so this nginx box will forward on to other nginx vm's. This way I can have multiple VMs running separate websites. And if one goes down, the others dont.


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/ipalias.jpg "ipalias")](/assets/2022-01-13/ipalias.jpg)

Firewall - Aliases - Add IP

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/ports2.jpg "ports2")](/assets/2022-01-13/ports2.jpg)

Firewall - Aliases - Ports

Firewall > NAT > Port Forward


[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/webports.jpg "web ports")](/assets/2022-01-13/webports.jpg)

Destination is WAN address. But this could be Firewall.

Then reboot NGINX VM.

Check IP Address is `172.16.44.101`

Check if `http://192.168.1.144/` which is the IP address of pfSense works after a few minutes. It did.

My workstation is `192.168.1.105`

## Summary so Far

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/pf2.jpg "port forwarding")](/assets/2022-01-13/pf2.jpg)

NAT Port forward rules

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/wanrules.jpg "wan rules")](/assets/2022-01-13/wanrules.jpg)

Auto created NAT linked rules. Only extra one is allowing access to pfSense Admin Ports from my private 192.168.1.0 network.

We'll done LAN rules below.

## Serve an App on NGINX

This will just be a reverse proxy soon, but for now lets put something on it:

## Setup NGINX Reverse Proxy - Part 4

[https://www.dlford.io/nginx-reverse-proxy-how-to-home-lab-part-4/](https://www.dlford.io/nginx-reverse-proxy-how-to-home-lab-part-4/)

Growing disk interesting here if we need to.

On our NGINX Reverse proxy

```bash

# sites-enabled is simply a sym link
# and has to be setup to point to whatever files we want in sites-available
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
#sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/4t-app.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# for simplicity I'm keeping the config in default

# reverse proxy for hmsoftware.org
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name hmsoftware.org;
    location / {
        proxy_read_timeout 36000s;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_buffering off;
        client_max_body_size 0;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";

        proxy_pass_header Authorization;
        proxy_pass http://172.16.44.102:5000;
    }
}

# reverse proxy for hmsoftware.uk
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name hmsoftware.uk;
    location / {
        proxy_read_timeout 36000s;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_buffering off;

        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_pass_header Authorization;
        proxy_pass http://172.16.44.103:5000;
    }
}

# test config
sudo nginx -t

# reload
sudo service nginx restart
```

Notice that host headers are on here, and then point to different machines which I've got listening on 5000.

The backend webserver don't need host headers and can just run as default.


## Secure SSH Remote Access - Part 5

[https://www.dlford.io/secure-ssh-access-how-to-home-lab-part-5/](https://www.dlford.io/secure-ssh-access-how-to-home-lab-part-5/)

Create a new VM - ap for access point.

Reject Non_Public

Can't go from LAN to any other machine on Non_Public ie can't get to other machines on LAN or my workstation. ie this is to protect my home network.

I had issues with outbound requests going from nginx server to outside world, so deleted subnets here except `192.168.0.0` which is fine for me.

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/allowicmp.jpg "allowicmp")](/assets/2022-01-13/allowicmp.jpg)

## Add Port Forward from the Outside World


Get Nginx listening on 443

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available

sudo apt install ssl-cert

#sudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil

# uncomment listen on 443
# uncomment snakeoil.conf
sudo vim default

sudo nginx -s reload

## comment back in the 443

```

I had a problem that I couldn't reach apt update server from nginx `172.16.44.101` ie probable firewall rule?

@Yes it was a problem with the deny rule.

Let's get SSL working on the local machine first:

[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1)

Use a self signed cert.

```bash
sudo -i

# I took just defaults as don't care - we'll setup up proper cert later
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt

# this tooks 10 minutes

ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;


# create new file
vim /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf

```
I used this ssl-params.conf

```bash

ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;
ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM;

```

then

```bash
# interesting sites-enabled is just a sym link 
vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default


server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        listen [::]:443 ssl;
        include snippets/self-signed.conf;
        include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

        root /var/www/htmldm;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

}

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/htmldm;

        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

```

then

```bash
# check firewall
ufw status

# test config
sudo nginx -t

sudo systemctl restart nginx

# works
curl http://localhost

# get a cert error 
curl https://localhost
```

Then try from workstation and it works!

I've got Dynamic DNS running from the router on `mateer.hopto.org`

Then trying a real domain (which used to point to `hmsoftwareuk.netlify.app`)

`hmsoftware.uk` should now alias to `mateer.hopto.org`

It works fine. Interestinly only Firefox allows me to see the invalid self signed cert, as I'm using HSTS.

My iPhone7 on 192.168.1.108 is sending out multicast DNS on UDP 5353. Used by Bonjour, AirPlay, Home Sharing and Printer Discovery.

I don't believe that UDP is being blocked on the 192.168.1.0 network, however it is being blocked coming into the WAN of pfSense ie it can't get into the 172.16.44.0 network. Which is good.

## Conclusion

It took me about 5 days of part time effort to get this working. After another 5 days it has worked very well and is serving the website well. Issues I've seen are:

- Need to pass the correct IP address from nginx reverse proxy to apache
- Would like to monitor traffic load
- Would like to move Plex server from my workstation onto Proxmox, but no rush



Overall I'm very happy with the current setup and am monitoring stability now.

## Overall Network Diagram

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/network.jpg "network")](/assets/2022-01-13/network.jpg)

I use

```bash
# ssh to hoverfly webserver on port 29
ssh pfsense -p 29

# hash-test machine running on 172.16.44.105 (static IP but no holes punched through)
ssh pfsense -p 30

```

hmsoftware.org is using mateer.hopto.org which is here (a test page!)

hmsoftware.uk is now using the hmsoftwareuk.netlify.app redirect (March 2022)

## Increase Disk Size

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/nospace.jpg "no space")](/assets/2022-01-13/nospace.jpg)

I didn't notice but I'd been creating VMs with an 8GB disk size above. And look above you can see I've used 100% of the space and the VM is not happy.

To extend the disk turned out to be more involved that I thought, so here is what I did.


[https://packetpushers.net/ubuntu-extend-your-default-lvm-space/](https://packetpushers.net/ubuntu-extend-your-default-lvm-space/) this was the blog post which helped me the most, and I've copied his excellent diagram:

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/pv.jpg "disk diagram")](/assets/2022-01-13/pv.jpg)

Going from the bottom

```bash
# list block devices
lsblk
```

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/blk.jpg "blk")](/assets/2022-01-13/blk.jpg)

Physical/Virtual disk of 8GB on `/dev/sda` - allocated from Proxmox.

3 partitions just like his on `sda1 sda2 sda3`

1 Physical Volume (PV) just like his on  `dev/sda3`
```bash
# show physical volumes 
sudo pvs
```
[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/pvs.jpg "pvs")](/assets/2022-01-13/pvs.jpg)

Check for existing free space on Volume Group (VG)

```bash
# is there free space on the Volume Group?
sudo vgdisplay
```

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/vgf.jpg "vgf")](/assets/2022-01-13/vgf.jpg)

No existing free space on my Volume Group.

## Make space being presented to linux

In summary this is what to do:

```bash
# allocate more space on hypervisor

# make the partition see the space (dev/sda3, Resize, Write, quit)
sudo cfdisk

# extend the physical volume from the partition
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3

# extend LV to use up all space from VG
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

# resize file system
sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv

# check can see the space on filesystem
df -h
```

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/28.jpg "28")](/assets/2022-01-13/28.jpg)

I increased space by 20GB to 28G while the machine was running

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/cf.jpg "cf")](/assets/2022-01-13/cf.jpg)

```bash
# partition editor similar to fdisk but with an interface
# make the partition see the space
sudo cfdisk
```
Can see the free space without a restart of the VM.

Select the `/dev/sda3` partition and select Resize, Write, q (for quit)

So the `/dev/sda3` partition backing the `/dev/sda3` Physical Volume (PV) has been extended, we need to extend the PV.

```bash
# extend the physical volume from the partition
pvresize /dev/sda3
```

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/res.jpg "res")](/assets/2022-01-13/res.jpg)

My physical volume (PV) can now see the 27GB.

## Volume Group

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/vg27.jpg "vg27")](/assets/2022-01-13/vg27.jpg)

Have unused (free) space in Volume Group.


## Logical Volume

```bash
# only 7GB
sudo lvdisplay

# extend LV to use up all space from VG
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

```

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/ext.jpg "ext")](/assets/2022-01-13/ext.jpg)

Can now see 27G in my Logical Volume (LV)

## File System

At this point the block volume underpinning our root filesystem has been extended bu thte filesystem itself has not been resized to fit that new volume.

```bash
# check current size of file system
df -h

# resize file system
sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
```

[![alt text](/assets/2022-01-13/fs.jpg "fs")](/assets/2022-01-13/fs.jpg)

Can see the space now in our filesystem! It worked!

## Automating Building of VMs

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/jo3bno/automate_proxmox_vm_creation_from_cloud_images/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/jo3bno/automate_proxmox_vm_creation_from_cloud_images/)

I'm going to try a backup/restore strategy of a vanilla VM to start with. This is because my networking requires a DHCP allocation based on MAC. So keeping it simple.


## CPU

I got this error whilst doing some Tensorflow work:

## Setting up remote access to a VM via SSH

[no-ip.com](https://no-ip.com) provides Dynamic DNS that gets my the my correct IP address via [http://mateer.hopto.org/](http://mateer.hopto.org/)

[![alt text](/assets/2023-05-16/1.jpg "fs")](/assets/2023-05-16/1.jpg)

I've currently got port 80 and 442 open on my plusnet router which port porward to pfsense (my firewall)


[![alt text](/assets/2023-05-16/2.jpg "fs")](/assets/2023-05-16/2.jpg)

The firewall accepts traffic on Web_Ports ie 80 and 443 from any Source Address ie the internet and my local network, and forwards it to the nginx reverse proxy.

You can see I've also got my local LAN allowed to SSH via different ports, which port forwards onto the correct VM via NAT.


[![alt text](/assets/2023-05-16/3.jpg "fs")](/assets/2023-05-16/3.jpg)

Lets do the simplest thing as a test and see if I can open up port 22 (SSH) to a spare VM (which could eventually become an access point).

I disabled a NAT rule which was the old port 22 for now. (goes to ngingx)

[![alt text](/assets/2023-05-16/4.jpg "fs")](/assets/2023-05-16/4.jpg)

Allowed port 22 from the outside world to the pfsense firewall

`ssh mateer.hopto.org`

Monitor logins on

```bash
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

Then from this access point machine I can hop onto other machines I need to admin.


[![alt text](/assets/2023-05-16/5.jpg "fs")](/assets/2023-05-16/5.jpg)

Bot attempts started within 25 minutes of the port being opened.

```bash
# list all unsuccessful logins
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```

Next up is to use [SSH keys instead](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-22-04)

```bash
# find local public key in WSL2 ./ssh/id_rsa.pub

# copy via ctrl c/v to ./ssh/authorized_keys on remote machine

# sort out permssions
chmod -R go= ~/.ssh

# test it all works
```
