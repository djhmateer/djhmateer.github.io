account plans - free plan gives access to web and desktop app, but need to pay for claude-code.

- Pro - $17pm (only access to Sonnet 4, no access to Opus 4.1)
- Max 5x - $100pm (nearly unlimited access to Sonnet 4). Good. 
- Max 20x - $200pm 

usage limits reset every 5 hours and get a warning when reaching limit.

Opus 4.1 eats through limits much faster
Sonnet 4 - good default 


```bash
# installs silently - maybe use --v
# to see what is happening
# took 3 minutes
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# to launch - but need a key
claude

claude --version
```

`can you provide me with a summary of what this project is`
    
### VS Code

If run claude inside VSCode then we get an extension which is automatically installed for

- selected text in editor is automatically added to claude context
- diff viewing
- alt cmd k - push selected code into claude prompt

## New Lines

`/terminal-setup` - VSCode terminal Shift+Enter key binding for newlines for claude-code chat

## Branch

`switch to a new branch called claude-edits`

## Init

`/init` - initialise a new CLAUDE.md file (for an existing project). Mini documentation for Claude Code to use.

## Website Create

`Create a very simple website that is for a habit tracking app. Create some mock-ups for the imagets, keep things super simple, but hink a beautiful design that comes from a designer agency that makes beautiful websites (that maybe cost like $10,000 to $15,000) as a demo for what Claude Code can do`

then

`get rid of npm - just want raw html, css, and js.. and claude.md`

I then could run the site using live server extension in vscode.
