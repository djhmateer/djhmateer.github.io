I'm based in the UK and want to see YouTube adverts from the US.

So a VPN is the best place to start

- [brightdata.com](brightdata.com) - their residential network VPN is good.

However what I'm finding is that I'm not getting corporate ad's, but just political or 'lower grade' ads which I don't want

## ExpressVPN

Nice UI. Easy to install. I found that some endpoints were better than others for YouTube streaming ie some gave me a bot detection message. Houston was good.

Â£10 per month

```bash
[Diagnostics] wintun_rings_write(...) ring is closed! head: 0xffffffff
[Diagnostics] wintun_write(...) wintun_rings_write failed with error: -1001
```

However I did get stability issues with the above messages in Diagnostics. Support came back with a generic message about turning things off and on again.



## ProtonVPN
