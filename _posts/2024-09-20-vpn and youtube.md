I'm based in the UK and want to see YouTube adverts from the US.

So a VPN is the best place to start

- [brightdata.com](brightdata.com) - their residential network VPN is good.

However what I'm finding is that I'm not getting corporate ad's, but just political or 'lower grade' ads which I don't want

## ExpressVPN

Â£10 per month
