I am building a greenfield SaaS (Software as a Service) product which is a Broken Link Checker.  

I've had nearly a decade of experience in Azure VM's / Containers / PaaS (Platform as a Service) and FaaS (Functions as a Service) for corporate clients.

## Eat my own dogfood

So now it is my money on the line, what infrastructure am I going to choose to run my first SaaS product?

## Bare Metal

Buy my own server hardware and co-locate it somewhere eg [Fastnet in Brighton](https://fastnet.co.uk/data-centre-hosting/).  No thanks. I'm not a hardware guy so want to abstract this away.

## VMs

asdf

## PaaS

Windows?
Linux - which is a docker container under the hood


## FaaS

Tempting to build out my service this way.

- Azure Durable Functions
- Azure Queues
- Azure SQL
