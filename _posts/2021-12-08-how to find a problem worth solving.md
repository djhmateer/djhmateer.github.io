I’ve worked for many companies over the last 20 years as an IT pro, then a developer. Setting up 2 freelancing companies has been interesting, and I’ve had 1 ‘product’ where a company asked me to host their very old classic asp application, which I begrudgingly did. Over the next 6 years I gradually put the price up, and smiled every month, as I’d automated all the day-to-day work, and the biggest hassle was sending invoices every month.

## Idea Validation the Market

[Rob Walling 2014 on Drip getting to $7k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLay7kksLtc)

What this video is good at, is coming up with a strategy for the initial part of the SaaS based entprepreneurial process:

In fact most people launch multiple ideas over the years, so idea validation is important.


What Markets do I have an audience in (reach) 

- Small to medium sized companies
- Education (Universities)
- IT Hosting companies
- IT service companies
- .NET Developers

[https://microconf.com/state-of-indie-saas](https://microconf.com/state-of-indie-saas) good report.
 45% of people developed the idea as a problem they had
 22% were a problem clients were having


 But maybe don't know the market, so will have to cold call or email or letters

To validate the market takes more than you and a few others. He tried with 17 letters, and Jason tried to with 40.

- Are there enough people that want it
- How can I find these people?

**book of problems**  I use [Trello](https://trello.com)

- Software developers are hard to keep
- Blue collar short term recruitment companies need timesheet document signing to avoid disputes
- Human Rights organisations needs document signing to avoid


Which problems in which markets to pursue? This is discussed below by Jason Cohen, and I agree that I want to target a 

- B2B market
- a large market with plenty of room for a niche ie multi million dollar


Initial Goal is to have 10 companies paying $99 per month. 

signs were:
 - mailchimp wasn't cutting it,aweber not cutting it etc.. ie unhappy with current product

so there may be a niche 

so he went for 17, and emailled 2 at a time

### how to build launch list

3400 on his list

### slow launch

built 5 months.. launched for 5 months 

### onboarding

They love podcasts.

$100k MRR

Zach Moreno - business
Rock - tech

Active creator.. made own show. SF Audio drama

A remote team. Need high quality audio quality.

Record Studio Quality Podcasts from Anywhere

4 years.

2 years with day jobs
3 years to $10k MRR
4 years to $100k MRR
4 years before paychecks

**good advice**
just focus on 1 thing eg remote recording
  lots of startups fail trying to do too much

be a professional founder
 - economics, pricing
Just in time learning
 figuring out customer support (high touch..careful.. )
JOMO - joy of missing out.. mantra of just being focussed

host meetups, foster conversations
 how to get involved in the community
 listen to community

show up everyday

focus
what are the goals
 get money
then invest in the business

learn from the greats
 eg podcasts...
 eg pricing.. and go to experts
  and implment

**advisors

speak at events!

## Pivot

I'm embarking on the journey of pivoting my consulting company to becoming more entrepreneurial

- Done ad-hoc consulting for 2 years (during covid) with 2 young kids and a wife with a full time academic job. Have earned not much money. But had the time to support everyone. Which has been great, but I'd like to remedy the money part.
- Have always wanted to be an entrepreneur
- It is a challenge and adventure
- Want to provide for my family
- I love the freedom of lifestyle of an entrepreneur

My strategy like programming, is to

- Research deeply - what are the canonical YouTube videos / books
- Find people who have been successful and copy them - youtube / podcasts / blogs
- Write about it (on this blog) to help cement thinking and help others
- Rank ideas
- Landing page
- Get out of the building and talk to customers

Brainstorm ideas - I use paper and pencil so I can work in coffee shops / other places to avoid distractions. Also OneNote on my mobile phone to take notes whilst listening to a podcast out walking.

## Learning a new skill

Is hard. Frustrating. Challenging. As a good programmer, do I want to be an entrepreneur? Solopreneur? Employ people?

Sitting at my kitchen table on a cold Wednesday morning in December listening to ZZ Top with limitless possibiliites in front on me (and my family). Exciting. When I'm sitting of my deathbed (hopefully not too soon!) I'll think of these adventures and hopefully all the people I've helped and inspired to be happy in the world.

Below is a summary of the what I've found to be the best resources, and commonalities of successfull entrepreneurs.

TL;DR

- pain and suffering
- marketing - getting out and speaking to a lot of people
- pivoting on an idea
- entrepreneurs seem alive and kind people, and inspired










## Successful Tech Entrepreneurs

Like good programmers, I like to hear stories from people who have a proven track record.

[Jason Cohen, Founder, WP Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw&t=3188s) - 2013 talk.

His summary at this time (ie 2013) was

> **Predictable** acquision of customers,
> of **recurring** revenue,
> with **annual prepay**,
> in a **good market**,
> creates a **cash machine**.

My focus currently is analysing markets and finding a good fit for my company.

- Big market eg $bn
- MRR
- Be a boutique company (ie very good / fast to do things / great service)

- B2B as B2C is hard
- Not real time eg analytics, metrics, reports, monitoring, Finance, Project Mgt, Content
- Not a marketplace eg etsy, amazon, kickstarter

[MicroConf 2021 - veed.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72DjfbJNh6M) - Video editing in the browser

Impressive has gone in 2 years from 2 founders to 60 employees.

first year was growth
- mvp just doing simple things
- push hard on marketing. quora, reddit, fb groups.. almost too hard. took 6 months for seo to kick in

second year
 - give up jobs when painful and hire people


[Productised Services - MicroConf podcast](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/blair-enns-productized-services)

90,000 data points go into an airline ticket price - the point is that we need to measure everything in business.

- Customised Service (consulting)
- Productised Service - faster, more battle tested, more bang for buck
- Product

[The Agent Nest - MicroConf podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INAbsv06gMg)

- Customer Pain - smaller niche
- Competitor Pain - larger (eg docusign being expensive)

This was a nice podcast of a founder doing $8k MMR.

Interesting she has gone back to free trial (1st Dec 2021) - maybe paid trial did not work.

[Thomas Smale - FE International](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/thomas-smale-what-to-do-before-building-a-saas) 

Fascinating podcast. Mergers and Acquisitions. 

Advice on starting a SaaS

- Be patient (if you're coming from freelancing). Is personal finance okay? 2 years until full time income
- Build something you know about, and enjoy the segment. Are people willing to buy?
- Be a student of the art and science of business.

Scratch own itch. Maybe not a good idea. It must be commercially viable.

How to see if an idea is viable?
- Write content
- Engage in communities - FB, Forums, Podcast (guest or own), Social Media, Videos make (youtube)
- Landing page - we're building secret product x. Sign up on waitlist.. then wait to see if get traction

maybe build a better version of something out there

ie start to engage with market in simplest way..

- Write content eg 50 articles, and maybe 1 will get traction
- Engage in communities - podcasts, social media, youtube, blogs
- Engage with market - I see this problem.. based on my observations..

ie talk around the problems you see.

- Chances are you will pivot with company

okay now have an idea, and it seems like people may buy it. What now.

- Keep producing content
- Ship something (he said so sad to see people with products not released!)
- Don't worry about branding, names. Make it functional 
- Iterate on what paying people want.
- May first 10 customers free, then 10 bucks?

There is vast sums of money out there to buy good businesses. Eg tech engineers out of big companies wanting to buy an existing business for 100k-2m. It seems 3 or 4x Net Profit can sell a company for. With a track record. Already successful. So they can immediately start working on it (they don't want the initial risky part of entrepreneurism).

Product - buyers want a good product which will be around in 10-50 years.

Find similar companies in your area and read their blogs.

[Entrepreneur x]()

A friend who owns companies has some ideas:

- What do you know how to market? Doesn't matter if it's competite vertical.. if have a new angle
- Find an affiliate program for a similar product, then make sales
- Use that knowledge to make your own product, or identify new opportunities -
- Amazon your own products
- Become an investor

> You can’t have a successful business without marketing, and that same marketing shapes the end product.

[Microconf 2017 - Ben Orenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n078RDNz6jY&t=12s)

Vim guy

8 min lighting talk on Ruby at a conf

made a screencast making vim screencasts
put on shopify for $9
people started following on twitter

emailled everyone from boston ruby group - released a product
first email was transformative

screencast $10k over time

retired and its on youtube vim for rails developers

1 - Teach
how to pick a topic
  what is something from 6 months ago that would have saved you time
	what are people asking you about
	what is something that you like, that bores other people eg billing and feelancing
begin small
  - co workers.. do a lunch and learn.. 8 miute talk 
	eg on Docker
	- lightning talks
	- 60 minute google hangout
	why
	 build an authority
	   get their email!
	 get practice teaching
	 do customer research
	 ask them 
	   what problems they have
		 etc..

2 - make an info product eg ebook
  one copy to one stranger
	small is beautiful!
	 a docker crash course
	 surviving your first week with docker
	 docker for total beginners
	 docker distilled
	 docker for non programmers
	 what I wish I'd know about docker when I'd started
	 why docker sucks and what you should use instead
40 page thing is fine
recommend - get an airbnb
 4 to 5 days..!!
  get groceries
	goal: write chapter of ebook.. meaty one
	    table of contents
	sales page - maybe leanpub
	   can pre sell


Part 2 - if you've started.

1. create a recurring reminder to run a price test every 6 months.
   nothing he has done is better than changing pricing
	  eg hide cheapest tier
		  or try doubling it

2. create an email course
  eg land your dream rails job
	  drip it out over 5 days
		that converted 10% of people that signed up.. to premium product
		2 weeks of setup

3. integrate and partner
   integrated with zapier
	    then zap wrote a blog post about them
			anohter great channel

		supposed competitor - did a deal with 30% bundled together.
		   $100k over 4 days
			did big cross post deal

4. Sell annual plans
     2 months free
		 day 86...am going to bill in 4 days
		 end of FY - send email.. simplify.. annual plan.

5. Put faces near things you want clicked
     - like sign up for email
		 - or buy now
	   used to be https://upcase.com - now it is https://thoughtbot.com

6. try a diving save
   cancellation.. mostly people don't have time.
	 so the day after cancel, email saying okay.
	   how about an annual plan with a big discount, saying you'll have time, and you'll save money
		 5% people say yes

7. start a podcast
   eg podcast editing service https://castos.com/podcast-editing-service/
	  not a huge time
		great
		  people say yes to podcast interview requests
			get them to tweet

8. manually onboard customers
    ie watch customers sign up live
		 get them to sign up.
		find out what is confusing them

		email box - to get founder to email you to help onboard
		https://calendly.com/ - automated schuling
		80% success

9. double down on things that work
eg snappa
 best performing blog post page was about free stock photos which drove people away from him
 so he doubled down... so he build a free stock photo site.. which drove people back

10. ask for help
 the more successful they are the more friendly and willing to help

[Drip - MicroConf 2015 Rob Walling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7esNsHnqAvc)

- How great marketing can make you fail faster
- 3 things you need to order to grow
- How to scale marketing

Email and SMS marketing for ecommerce brands [https://www.drip.com/](https://www.drip.com/)

- Build something people want (hard) - product market fit.
- Find your position
- Scale

Keep employee count down, revenue up.

They started with $50pm and $99pm

If you dont have ROT numbers, go and figure out why people are churning. It means that it isn't the right product yet.

ie only a £8k MRR.. they had 125 customers paying at least $49

email to say please spare 15seconds on why you cancelled. was too expensive

- lower price
- build more features

2/3 people don't want this.

He then replied.. saying sorry to hear this..what could we do to charge this.. what features would be good.

The filter these comments though your gut.. does it fit vision.. then talk to your mastermind (cofounder?)

Build or Not?
- Does it fit in my vision of the product?
- Will this feature matter in 2 years
- Will it grow the business?

A few months of thinking about this.

- Built a rules engines... in a few months.. then got to $11k MRR. So people wanted this rules engine. Ah - good product market fit.

How to be different

- Take a position in a category... you are the xxx in the market eg wpengine is the fast wordpress host, drip is email marketing, close.io is CRM - turn your leads into revenue. eg make calls and send email sthrough app., baremetrics.com - metrics of stripe for subscriptions businesses.

- Compare features.. can confuse users

He does a call every 2 weeks to his 'mastermind' course.

"Lightweight marketing automation that doesn't suck"

took 3 months.

they A/B tested this really well

Goal: $20k MRR after 6 months

Same figures as below.. 
he wanted 50% of people on inial list to convert

needed 115 trials per month
3/4 of signups at $49pm
1/4 at $99pm
9,200 targeted visitors per month


build
learn - positioning, marketing
scale

playbook

step1 - collect email addresses.. even a list of 1000 or 2000 people
 eg announce webinar, new features, product, blog posts

step2 - ad retargetting eg pefect audience which is [https://sharpspring.com/ads/](https://sharpspring.com/ads/), adroll

concentric marketing
 - your audience..  2 blog post.. personal and on getdrip. aimed at audience.. not features.. spent 16 hours writing both posts, emailed 17k people.. then got quite a lot of trials. almost 200 trials then back to 100. 
  then audio thing 4k to 5k listens

 - friends/network audience - colleagues audience... **integrations**.. integration marketing
    gumroad, kickofflabs, zapier, membermouse
		also go on podcasts eg growth hacker, wpelevation, wheniuwrk, stunning, bootstrapped web


 - cold audience (eg paid advertising).. harder to convert
   publish blog article on drip blog every week. he doesn't do it himself. work tihgt with tehm to define headline.   
	  also he cold emailled .. after he did an integration with them
		google ads.. hard.. but works
		all 10% on integrations above

summary
- Build something people want.. could get to $12k.. but hard
- Position .. could get to $20k but hard
- Sclae

This is 10 years of working.

Get to revenue very quickly!!!!
jan-jun excruitiating... 2015 was necky. anxiety..



[Ditching hourly - .NET Software Architecutal consultant](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/coaching-call-with-george-stocker)

This is a very important role as 

- Ask CEO's what problmes they have eg app doesn't work under load/scale (outages on a big day), data centres expensive, want to go into other markets but can't becuase of tech. Not resolving bugs fast enough, not putting in features fast enough.

Why are the above bad? 

- Losing confidence by investors
- Customers can't buy product if site down
- Brand damage

This call cemented my thoughts that I don't want to head in this direction. Even though I can, and have the technical skills to do it.

- Stressful working with teams showing them a different way
- Deal with egos
- Generally a consultant parachuting in quickly and wont be well liked
- Fills me with dread
- Much nicer to be building rather than fixing others 'mistakes' who are still there

This is fine for some people

I liked his strategy of:

- Stakeholder interview - what will team and business let you change. Talk to people who built system, and to customers of the system
- Assessment/Audit - how does the system work?
- Architecture analyse how to break apart - typically go towards event driven architectures

Then propose

- Stopgap fix
- Longer term strategy ie fix well
- Focos on 1 piece

And his final marketing to a vertical like:

> Dear Fintec CEO. Are you having problems with outages / regulation problems / slow release of new features

He used [LinkedIn Sales navigator](https://www.linkedin.com/premium/products-v2/?intentType=FIND_LEADS&upsellOrderOrigin=guest_login_sales_nav) to find leads ie  fintec companies of a certain size.

Verticals - who do I enjoying haning out with / talking to 

- Fintech
- Alcohol sales
- AI

between 50 and 250 size company
tec team between 10 and 50

transistor.fm co-founder

look at things you are involved with
  eg digital signage

fundementals work on, so can **catch a bigger wave**
  - write out them
  - talk on podcasts

get out and talk to people!
look for conferences that people pay to go to

Courses are hard. But there is an **underlying demand** for
 - Raw skills eg PHP skills course.. [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/) refactoring to collections course. book + 4 hours video. $150k in 1 month. Made tailwindcss too!
 - Less for devs who are making products (and want to learn marketing)
 - bust less for devs who want to learn marketing

- Resources you have
- Exposure
- Skills
- Brand
- Passionate about SEO.

Look for something with a bigger wave? bigger momentum? ie what markets to go for?

Learn the fundamentals.. be there every day.


1.5m podcasts. Most are free and on anchor. Most have only 1 episode. Paid podcasting market leader is buzzsprout who have 80k, lipsync has 75k customers. fairly small category overall.

Transistor is >$1mARR with a 4 person company. He is probably north of $250k per year (inferred)

A lot of small businesses are barely above the watermark...if you're just getting a middling success you're not getting paid for the risk.

him and his wife

16 remote team members
0-14,000 customers

interesting people met!

### 1 - no audience = no business
 ie blog, youtube channel, email list.. something...
 podcast - but it didn't move the needle. 46 episodes. didn't work, webinars
 Then did a podcast - the $100MBA show. 1200 epidoes. 90million downloads.. 10 minutes episodes
   120k daily listeners!

### 2 - webinars.. teach on video.. then run offers
  first one was 10 people showing up
	 he did loads

	 then did diy webinar guide... 2 sales.

*sometimes you need to create a bad product, to create a good one.

### 3 - always be profitable
they pre-sold webinar ninja
he had 3,000 people on his email list.
In 48 hours he sold his first 150 spots (at $300 a time). He had the webinars, so people trusted him.
  first 250 spots lifetime access... 60 days after deliver for refud
	launched and it was full of bugs
	he called.. and asked them for feedback!

how get to 14k users


### 4 Relationships are your biggest assett
 half of the first 250 were from the conference

some guy just helped him out..ny times best seller 

selfless, helpful, kind... just want to be a friend and a good person.

- make a list of 60 people
- message 5 people a week... just for fun. Message/WhatsApp/Tweet
- intro 1 person a week.. do you know...
- do for 12 weeks

ie be a connector to people.
be in touch with people you like being in touch with.
growing relationships is important.

### 5 This is supposed to be hard
it is a struggle!!!

idea phase - nice.. sunny.. good feeling.. inspired!
sweat.. sales not so good
plateuing..eg 8k MRR.. a lot of companies stop here.
now got to start doing other stuff... advice?...coach. don't be too proud... 

There are lots of challenges.. and it always becomes different challenges
 growth!!!

 Teaching is nice.. that is their advantage.
 he is in touch with what users want.. 500 webinars

QandA
 sold the 250 spots
  they have become the biggest cheerleaders of the platform



[How to validate your idea and launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLay7kksLtc) Rob Walling 2014

- An approach to idea validation
- How to build launch list
- Benefits of a slow launch
- Good onboarding

Scrath own itch.. maybe not a good idea in general to do so eg

- Bug tracker
- CRM system
- Project management suites

**1. validate the market**

problems to solve
 what reach do I have? TSG, Human Rights, Qnrl gang, homebrew beer makers, runners

Market first

eg 10 people who will pay $99 per month.

he emailed 17 people over 8 weeks

Summary of Approach to Idea Validation

- Start with problems
- Niche down eg software saas first
- Describe the value you will provide
- Name a price
- Hold idea loosely eg get feedback to be worth $99

**2. build**
put a landing page up first







## Terminology

Product market fit

Revenue - aka Gross Sales, Turnover, Top Line. Is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services related to the primary operations of the business

Profit - aka Net Income, Total Earnings

Growth rate
 
Churn - frist 60 days take out.. they had 18%.. early days want it to be 10%

Trial to Conversation rate - want to be between 40 and 60% as a rule

Survivor bias - don't copy successful people?

Rolodex moment - what do I want to be know for? ie what vertical and specialisation do I want to be in.

Disruptors - ie jetski companies (as opposed to large ship) that can move fast

Survivorship bias - correlation "proves" causality. ie a company succeeds, but not becuase of the reasons the founders think. ie is a form of selection bias. Ie becuase the founders selected to do certain things the company succeeded. not necessarily true.

Launch list - emails / contacts to contact when ready to launch

## ROT

ROT (Credit card up front)
- Visit to Trial: 0.7%-2%... with low credit card eg 10-20bucks should be higher eg 1.5-2%
- Trail to Paid: 40-60%
- First 60/90 day churn: 20-40%
- Post 60/90: 4-7%

## Informational Sites

## Podcasts

[https://artofproductpodcast.com/](https://artofproductpodcast.com/) - benorenstein.com

## Types of Companies

Consulting to advise (and possibly build)

Customised Service to build 
 - More creative - a blank slate at the start of each


Productised service
  - Faster, Battle Tested, more bang for buck
	- no

Product
[https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/](https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/) suggests a simple product first 

- Sell one offs.. and sell consulting / enterprise 
eg member communities
training eg sell videos
info product - can sell this faster


- SaaS ie web.. subscription model - where you really want to be, but more comples

## Numbers want to track

Number of paying customers

Number of trails
 - can graph number of trials every day.

Revenue per month

## Blah
Here are some steps in a successful company

- Build product (up to 10-20k MRR) - maybe this is a good goal for a solopreneur to start with ie same salary level as a senior programming role.
- Build business (0.5-1m ARR)
- Build company

Building product

- Shipping features
- Marketing copy
- Closing sales

Going fast in this segment is fine (veed.io quote). Tech debt is okay.

When you get to the build company part, the job of a ceo/founder is:

- set vision and communicate
- pay bills
- hire people
