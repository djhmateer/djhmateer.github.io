My ISP (Plusnet) sent me a new router after I signed up again with them for another 2 years.

Lets see how good the new router is compared to the older plusnet hub one. [pictured here](/2022/01/12/home-web-server)

Summary

- Can it handle WiFi6? (no)
- Is the range any better?
- I've got 14 days cooling off period for new contract (until April the 19th) which is Â£24.99 per month which gives me around 48 down and 11 up. The biggest reason I'm still with them is good customer service. ie they answer the phone and sort billing problems out quickly.
- I've got a [proxmox server](/2022/01/13/proxmox) hosting a website so need 80 and 443 port forwarded
- I use dynamic dns - NoIP
- I need static reserved IP internal addresses so proxmox works well.
- I'm splitting 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands as have [dropoff/switching](/2022/03/05/5ghz-wifi-on-windows) lag on some devices (Windowns desktop and iPhone7). Favouring 5GHz. No I'm not!!!!

## Wifi

```
| Gen     | Standard | Band            |
| ------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Wi-Fi 1 | 802.11b  | 2.4 GHz         |
| Wi-Fi 2 | 802.11a  | 5 GHz           |
| Wi-Fi 3 | 802.11g  | 2.4 GHz         |
| Wi-Fi 4 | 802.11n  | 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz |
| Wi-Fi 5 | 802.11ac | 5 GHz           |
| Wi-Fi 6 | 802.11ax | 5 GHz           |
```
[From the SO Question](https://superuser.com/questions/1400086/can-you-disable-the-2-4ghz-band-on-a-wi-fi-card)

## Hmm

[fasterbroadband router review](https://www.fasterbroadband.co.uk/broadband-reviews/plusnet)

No Wi-Fi6

Can't separate the 2.4 and 5GHz networks [here](https://community.plus.net/t5/Tech-Help-Software-Hardware-etc/Separate-Bands-with-a-Smarthub-2-or-Plusnet-Hub-2/td-p/1843141)

speed seems the same at 45.5 and 13.6

This is nice to see all the devices.


So it seems the new router doesn't do some of the things I want.

## Testing

Lets see if I get annoying lags whilst it negotiates in far flung parts of the house.

A workaround is to use a 2.4GHz bridge (extender)
