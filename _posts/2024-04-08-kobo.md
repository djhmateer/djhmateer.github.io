[Kobo Libra 2](https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2) is an ebook reader which I own.

I can borrow library books on it which is great! This is the major reason I bought it (in the UK Kindle devices can't borrow from local libraries like in the US), as was tired of giving money to Amazon on their kindle platform. Which is good!
