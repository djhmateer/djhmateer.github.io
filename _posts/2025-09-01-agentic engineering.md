[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBWnH0YA6tg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBWnH0YA6tg) Stop Letting AI Wing It - Take control of coding

Let's make an app for my local speedwatch group

I've got a private GH repo called speedwatch.

I'll be using agentic ai to help me with these phases

- Researcher
- Architect - standards and structure. (structure documents eg software principles - DRP, SRP.. hmmm)
- Product Manager - define the what. bit sized prds. inputs,outputs,edge cases.
- Engineer
- Tester

## Init

Git init

Good to claude a `CLAUDE.md` file (/init) so can setup defaults like

- Don't commit to source control unless I say

This needs to go into a `.claude-rules` file.

## Research

PRD - Product Requirements Document

Essentially this is a great idea for any project as it helps you define what you're doing before doing it. 

- Who are the customers?
- What are the benefits to them?

Also agentic wise

- Gather information
- Take screenshots (what is wrong with current system)
- Draw on screenshots what I want / what is wrong?

- Get data
- Research user needs
- Look at good and bad experiences
