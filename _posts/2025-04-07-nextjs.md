I'm working with a client who has a business application close to v1 release using this stack:

-asdf

It has been an impressive development effort by a talented single young developer in the company (of around 150 people).

As the application is at the core of what the company does, the risk of all the knowledge being with a single developer is large.

I've been brought in to

- Get the project released ie v1 - essentially get the developer focussed on the remaining large features to do
- Write documentation so that the I / others can support it and develop on it
