## What is a graph database

## Why use one

## Examples in MSSQL

MSSQL introduced Graph functionality in SQL2017, then included more in SQL2019 (specifically a `shortest_path` implementation)

[RedGate 2017 example](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/sql-graph-objects-sql-server-2017-good-bad/)

[RedGate 2019 follow up example with shortest_path](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/sql-development/sql-server-2019-graph-database-and-shortest_path/)

## ORMs

[Entity Framework doesn't have support yet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46733719/syntax-for-entity-framework-query-to-sql-server-2017-graph-database) 

## Neo4J

Is a popular JVM based Graph database. There is an official [.NET driver for it too](https://neo4j.com/developer/dotnet/)
