I've always wanted to have a products business! Like many developers I really enjoy building stuff ie creating software.  How hard can it be to build something and sell it to > 1 person?

5 [Startup nomenclature]

I've worked for many companies over the last 20 years, and done consulting/freelancing. I've had 1 'product' where a company asked me to host their very old classic asp application, which I begrudgingly did. Over the next 6 years I gradually put the price up, and smiled every month, as I'd automated all the day-to-day work, and the biggest hassle was sending invoices every month.  

So after working for an amazing company for nearly 7 years, and having 2 children, the time is right to start a new venture.

The current plan is to bring in regular income via [How to start freelancing/contracting](/2019/07/18/How-to-start-Freelancing-and-Contracting), and look for opportunities around software products eg SaaS (Software as a Service), then do it.

## Research on SaaS

I'm learning about software startups and SaaS products now. It seems like the a normal route is for a developer (like me, who can build stuff) to build something which in their mind is awesome, then wait for customers to come to them :-) So I suspect that I'll have to devote almost equal measures of focus on building something/business ie:

- Sales
- Product Development
- Marketing
- Entrepreneurship

- Presentation Skills
- Writing Skills
- Negotiation Skills

Learning about any new area, I like to do as much research as possible to try and avoid making the same mistakes as everyone else. [Starting a SaaS company book reviews](/2019/07/18/Starting-a-SaaS-company-book-reviews).
