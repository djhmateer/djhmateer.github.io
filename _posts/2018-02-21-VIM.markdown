I use Vim bindings in VSCode, and I use VSCode Autosave. 

After 4 months of using Vim here are my most used commands.

## Vim commands
```
h,j,k,l - j (down), h (left), k (right), l (up) 

i - insert
I - insert at the beginning of line
A - append to end of line
o - insert on next line
a - append (same as insert just goes to next character)

esc - Normal modej

$ - end of line
0 - beginning of line

gg - start of file
G - end of file

x - delete character under cursor

w - next word
b - previous word

yy - yank line
p - put text after the cursor
P - put here

rx - replace this character with an x
shift R - replace mode

ce - change word
c$

dd - delete line (or cut line)
D - delete to end of line
de - delete word including last character
. - repeat last command (commonly use with dw)

u - undo
ctrl r - redo


~ - change case of character

/ - search
n - next in search

:q! - quit without saving
:wq - write then quit

:e .  - open up file browser

```

## GVim
I'm experimenting with using GVim for it's file browsing capabilities.

```

set belloff=all
```
