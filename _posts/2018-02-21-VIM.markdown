I use Vim bindings in VSCode, and I use VSCode Autosave. 

After 4 months of using Vim here are my most used commands.

## Vim commands
```
h,j,k,l - j (down), h (left), k (right), l (up) 

i - insert
o - insert on next line
a - insert at next character

esc - back to 

$ - end of line
0 - beginning of line

gg - start of file
G - end of file

x - delete character

w - next word
b - previous word

yy - yank line
p - paste on next line
P - paste here

dd - delete line (or cut line)
D - delete to end of line
dw - delete word
. - repeat last command (commonly use with dw)

u - undo
ctrl r - redo

shift R - replace mode

~ - change case of character

/ - search
n - next in search

```

## GVim
I'm experimenting with using GVim for it's file browsing capabilities.

set wrap
" Turn off the beep when you press escape
set belloff=all
```
