## _vimrc
This optional config file on a windows machine is in c:\users\dave
```

set wrap
" Turn off the beep when you press escape
set belloff=all
" synatx highlighting
colo desert

## VSCode
Sometimes the plugin stops working. [Deleting the extensions directory](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36751445/26086) seems to work

## Vimtutor
Is an application installed. Essentially a text file that you go through in Vim teaching you about Vim :-) I get to it by typing windows key, Vim Tutor
