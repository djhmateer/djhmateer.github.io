UK Internet can take many weeks to switch on, so the ideal interim measure is to use a Personal hotspot on a mobile phone. Easy?! I think not.  

After moving a few times in the last year and now paying for my own mobile phone, this is what I now do:  

> Buy 4 SIM card for the 4 mobile networks at the supermarket for 99p each. Then test the actual coverage from my new house.

## Mobile Phone Networks

There are 4 physical phone networks in the UK. Others such as Tesco piggyback.

- EE (which are ex Orange, T-Mobile and Hutchison 3G)
- Three
- O2
- Vodaphone

## Deals

For me it didn't matter. All the areas I've lived in have had marginal coverage, so I bought the best plan available for that network.  

[Three offer unlimited (1TB)](http://www.three.co.uk/Store/SIM/Plans_for_phones) are very exciting especially if you can get 5G.

## Tethering (personal hotspot)

I mistakenly thought using some old phones would be a good idea. They didn't get as good a signal as my new(ish) iPhone7. So the moral of the story is to use a new phone!

## Boosting the signal

[The ultimate campervan setup](https://www.gjot.uk/the-ultimate-campervan-4g-wifi-setup/) has an interesting link on putting in a signal booster for 4G coverage for data. This looks very interesting.

[mobilerepeater.co.uk](https://www.mobilerepeater.co.uk/blogs/boost-signal/iphone-signal-booster-guide) looks like a good start for boosting a signal, and [4G Mobile Phone Signal Boosters](https://www.mobilerepeater.co.uk/collections/4g-signal-boosters) may be worth trying out, perhaps with a money back guarantee?

[Specifically this one](https://www.mobilerepeater.co.uk/collections/all-mobileboosters/products/mr-4g-pro-kit-4g-data-ee) may be worth trying for fun.

## Links

[SpeedTest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) on the mobile phone gives a good idea of speed

[OpenSignal](https://www.opensignal.com/) provide independent maps and data on signal coverage.

## Conclusion

Chatting to friends in the know there are some opinions (for the SE of England anyway)

- O2 is a good network but EE better in some locations
- No love for Three (coverage lacking, and hesitancy about ability to keep providing unlimited)
- O2 data is expensive ie Â£30 for 100GB (but probably get good reliability)
