I started blogging 8 years ago with [Programgood - First Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20170324063932/http://www.programgood.net/2008/11/08/GoalsBackgroundOfProgramGoodNet.aspx)  It turned into a very good ideas repository, not a blog.  *That's fine.*  

I'd now like to try a more 'walkthrough' style blog, taking inspiration from [hanselman.com](https://www.hanselman.com) and [ScottGu](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5)

Like all research projects, I start with [OneNote](https://products.office.com/en-gb/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) so I can share notes across all devices (2 at home, 1 at work and iPhone)

## Why Blog

* Helps you learn (by the act of writing down logically)
* Help others
* Build brand as a developer so you can earn good money
* Carrot to 'finish' writing projects
* Sharpen communication through written word
* Makes you Happy! (when others read what you write and care!)
* Tell stories

## Titles

What is in it for your reader?

What are you passionate about?  It really doesn't matter how much of an 'expert' you are at a subject.  If you care enough to write on a subject, then damn, **get on it**, and write it.  More than likely, others will care about the same.

## Who are your (fabulous) target audience

Jeff Bezos - write the press release first.

"davemateer.com blog is where to go, to find in-depth tutorial articles on high performance business applications which are maintainable"

"Dave Mateer is a professional software developer who can make *simple* *performant* and *maintainable* code"

## How to reach your (awesome) audience

-Talk at conferences
-Answer questions on SO and link to articles
-Do code reviews are link to articles
-Pluralsight make videos
-Youtube

## Blogging Advice Articles

[Blogging Advice for Beginners](https://buffer.com/resources/blogging-advice-for-beginners-from-16-experts)  

I liked 'Get ideas from your audience', specifically if someone asks you an interesting question then write a blog post to answer that question. I was asked recently about how to get the 'meta tags' so that Twitter previews work well. So I [wrote a blog post on it](/2019/04/07/Twitter-card-open-graph-site-preview).

## Conclusion

Blogging is good - go for it!
