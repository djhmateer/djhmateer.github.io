I've been running Proxmox 7 in production for the last 2.5 years. It's been sitting in my home on a small PC connected straight to the router and has been incredably useful. 

- started with [bare metal](https://davemateer.com/2022/01/12/home-web-server)
- moved to [Proxmox 7 beginners guide](https://davemateer.com/2022/01/12/home-web-server)


## Lessons Learned

- SSD's fail. 
- Hardware fails.
- You always need more disk space than you think on a VM
- Home connection with dynamic DNS has been great. Was 48Mbps down and 12MMbps up. Now on fibre at 400/100.
- Backups are super important
- Template VM's useful for spinning up test VM's quickly
- pfSense is hard
- System has been very reliable
- Been invaluable for archiving as many services now (eg YouTube) will block cloud based IP's


## General Setup

- Server is set to auto power on (in bios) in event of power cycle 

- Router forwards port 80 and 443 (and sometimes port 22) to pfSense
- [pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org/) for NAT and Firewall
- Nginx reverse proxy forwards web traffic to appropriate internal website VMs
- Access point for admin while I'm away is an Ubuntu VM with SSH keys and [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) and [here](/2022/07/29/proxmox#secure-ssh-remote-access---part-5)

I can connect to any VM via my WSL2

```bash
# have mapped different ports to different internal machines
ssh pfsense -p 39

```

## VM Websites / APIs

[http://mateer.hopto.org/](http://mateer.hopto.org/) is the name I got from [https://www.noip.com/](https://www.noip.com/) which my router talks to to provide dynamic DNS.

I've got an Nginx reverse proxy in front of all websites which forwards traffic to a specific internal IP via http. It also handles certificates via [certbot](/2023/10/12/certbot-on-nginx-reverse-proxy)

- [hoverflylagoons.co.uk](https://hoverflylagoons.co.uk/) - Apache / PHP . MySQL - 2GB
- [theskatefarmcic.co.uk](https://theskatefarmcic.co.uk/) - Apache / PHP / MySQL - 2GB
- API that runs a hatespeech AI called from [https://osr4rightstools.org/](https://osr4rightstools.org/)
- website that runs firemap called from 

Maybe move over

- [https://osr4rightstools.org/](https://osr4rightstools.org/) - .NET 1GB RAM. **todo** - certbot for certs
- [https://auto-archiver.com/](https://auto-archiver.com/) - .NET 1GB RAM **todo** certbot for certs
- [https://arlawesi.org.uk/](https://arlawesi.org.uk/) - .NET 1GB RAM **todo** certbot for certs

Test sites

- [https://hmsoftware.org/](https://hmsoftware.org/) - test site #1. Have used for Rails 
- [https://hmsoftware.uk/](https://hmsoftware.uk/)


Sites hosted elsewhere

- [https://hmsoftware.co.uk](https://hmsoftware.co.uk) - static site hosted on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) main company website which is being developed soon into a portfolio site
- [homebrewbeer.netlify.app](https://homebrewbeer.netlify.app/) - Hugo based static site on Netlify
- [https://davemateer.com/](https://davemateer.com/) - Jekyll blog on [pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)


## VM Workers 

- General archiver eg [auto-archiver.com/](https://auto-archiver.com/) - Python which runs fine in 4GB RAM
- Tweet service that polls an Azure database every minute to see if any Tweets to send out. Python. 1GB RAM
- YouTube screenshotter archiver - I'm using [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/) via a Proxy [brightdata.com/](https://brightdata.com/) and using headful Firefox 

## Networking

Plusnet Two Router / DHCP is on [192.168.1.254](http://192.168.1.254/)

Proxmox is on a static IP allocation of [192.168.1.139](http://192.168.1.139:8006/) - port 8006 gives us the Proxmox web UI

pfSense VM has a DHCP (!fix this) alloction of [192.168.1.144](https://192.168.1.144:8080/) - port 8080 gives us the pfSense web UI

All port 80 and 443 traffic is routed to pfSense from the router.

## Power Costs

Big server may draw 300W at idle. eg dual xeon

My UK provider [good energy]() charges me 24.70 pence per kWh on 3rd Sept 2024. And 59.18 pence per day 

So the xeon server would cost 0.3 kW x 24 hours = 7.2 kWh/day = £1.78 / day
£53 / month

My 13th Gen Intel draws about 40W at idle running wifi, disks, etc..
40W

## Hardware



## Storage

So after my drive failure(s) of consumer ssd's, I want to make my server more resilient.

- m.2 2 * 1TB ?
- SSD

Mirror the m.2 drives for the OS
