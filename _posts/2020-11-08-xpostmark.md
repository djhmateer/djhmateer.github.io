[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) delivers emails for applications.



## Customer Service

## Testing

[Testing email](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1213-best-practices-for-testing-your-emails-through-postmark) so I'm not using mailinator anymore but forwarding to `devtest@mydomain.com` and `bouncetest@mydomain.com`

They have a test API key too.
