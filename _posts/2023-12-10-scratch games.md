Kids love games, and Scratch is a good platform to play with. Lets explore some actual games which allow us to find out about Scratch.


## Guess a Number Game

Just thinking one up.

- between 1 and 20
- there is a timer
- beat the clock.
- the 10 number gets larger each time (so dopamine  )
- there is a leaderboard    

First try took an hour or so

- variables





- countdown timer
- better way to display messages
- leaderboard
