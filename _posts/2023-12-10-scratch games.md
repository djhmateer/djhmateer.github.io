Kids love games, and Scratch is a good platform to play with. Lets explore some good games which allow us to find out about Scratch.

I'm actually looking for fun games to play!

Current favourites are:

- Cookie Cutter, but this is quite complex

## Guess a Number Game

Just thinking one up.

- between 1 and 10
- there is a timer
- beat the clock.
- the 10 number gets larger each time (so dopamine  )
- there is a leaderboard    


## Flappy bird

asdf


## Dinosaur game
asdf

space invaders
frogger
