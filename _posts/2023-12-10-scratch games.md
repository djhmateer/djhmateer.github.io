Kids love games, and Scratch is a good platform to play with. Lets explore some actual games which allow us to find out about Scratch.

## Cat Number Guess 

Just thinking one up.

- between 1 and 20
- there is a timer
- beat the clock.
- the 10 number gets larger each time (so dopamine  )
- there is a leaderboard    

First try took an hour or so

- variables


maybe do next:

- countdown timer
- better way to display messages
- leaderboard

## Maybe Pong

[almost pong](https://www.lessmilk.com/almost-pong/)

Have got the start screen working which is a slightly rotating ball and space to start.

Then I've got a ball bouncing off both sides horizontally working.

This is gravity - the ball bounces and eventually stops. If we set -0.8 to 1, it will never stop bouncing (in fact it will bounce off the top)

yVelocity is currentYVelocity

This code was generated by AI

Bounces horizonally too (never stops as xVelocity is -1).

### Gravity ball - y - space

debug_message very handy. Trying to get the space bar to act like in almost pong. Using the simplest y only example here to see how I can get this to work.
