- React
- Next.js
- Javascript / Typescript

I've been a server side web programmer for a long time - PHP / Coldfusion / .NET / Rails / Python / Jekyll / Hugo and raw HTML / CSS

The closest javascript I've done is

- tailwind css for [https://osr4rightstools.org/](https://osr4rightstools.org/) and [https://hmsoftware.co.uk/](https://hmsoftware.co.uk/)

Have made complex web apps by having fast server side code which has created very simple and easy to maintain apps.

So why try a front end library/framework?

- I've got a client who is building a very impressive front end app in a profressional way
- [tailwind templates](https://tailwindui.com/templates) comes in React and Next.js
- I own a software company and customers expect products to be slick / interactive / responsive
- It is fun to learn (and incredably useful to keep learning how to learn as a professional - does ChatGPT help now?)
- I teach at a local coding club - so learning how to learn something new is important

## React

[https://tailwindui.com/templates/salient](https://tailwindui.com/templates/salient) uses

- Next.js v14
- Headless UI v2.1
- TypeScript v5.3
- Tailwind CSS v3.4
- React v18

> please explain what react is (the javascript framework) as a beginner

`JavaScript library for building especially single page applications where you want the content to feel dynamic and responsive`

- Component based eg a building block of the UI. button / header or section. Can reuse components.
- Virtual DOM - lightweight copy of DOM that React keeps in memory
- JSX - JavaScript XML. HTML like syntat in JavaScript code.

## Node.js and nvm and npx

> please show me how to make my first React program

Install Node.js which allows JavaScript code to be run server side. It uses Google's V* engine which is used in Chrome. It compiles direct to machine code making Node.js fast and efficient.

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a version manager for node.js

```bash
# install or update nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

# 0.40.1 on 4th Nov 24
nvm --version


# Node.js (LTS) if 22.11.0 on 4th Nov 24
nvm install --lts

# make the lts version the default for new terminal sessions (it was 20 on my machine)
nvm alias default node

node --version

# Node Package Manager
# 10.9.0 (in node v22)
npm --version


```

npx lets you run Node.js packages and scripts directly without globally installing them

```bash
# uses node package create-react-app  (5.0.1)
npx create-react-app my-first-app

```

[![alt text](/assets/2024-11-04/1.jpg "email"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2024-11-04/1.jpg) 

First experience - it just hung! 

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

[![alt text](/assets/2024-11-04/2.jpg "email")](/assets/2024-11-04/2.jpg) 
[![alt text](/assets/2024-11-04/2.jpg "email"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2024-11-04/2.jpg) 

So it didn't hang. Just insanely slow. This is after 20 minutes.
