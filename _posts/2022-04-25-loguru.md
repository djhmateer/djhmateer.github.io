Good logging is important in production to diagnose issues.

[loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) is a python logging library

```py
# pip install loguru

from loguru import logger

# outputs to stderr by default
logger.debug("That's it, beautiful and simple logging!")
```

[Standard logging levels]() and trace and success. [When to Use different levels](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031163/when-to-use-the-different-log-levels)

- trace - used when tracing code
- debug.. eg program level.. args passed in, up. Helpful to more than just developers.
- info. eg business logic eg trying archiver. 
- success.. eg youtube archiver succeeded
- warning.. eg twitterarchiver can't get tweet (and then goes to wayback).
- error eg incorrect connection strings
- critical

## Log Warnings and above to separate file

[docs](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#easier-file-logging-with-rotation-retention-compression)

```py
logger.add("trace.log", level="TRACE")
logger.add("warnings.log", level="WARNING")

```

## Top level handler

```py
# loguru catchall decorator
@logger.catch
def main():
 
```
