My journey so far in exploring Functional Programming in C# and the resources I've found most useful:

## Why learn FP techniques
[NDC Video by Enrico Buonanno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJq86IXkFdQ) has a very good introduction as to why we should consider FP in C# - he is the author of the book linked below. 

- Power (do more with less code, raise the level of abstraction)
- Safety (avoiding unnecessary side effects makes code easier to reason about)
- Clarity (we spend more time maintaining and consuming existing code than writing new. Achieving clarity will become more natural)

I have a tricky programming problem, which I've tried and the code is rapidly turning into complex unmaintainable spaghetti. So this is my reason.

As a side effect it has pushed my C# language skills and is thoroughly enjoyable!

## Strategy
- Be patient
- Experiment in code

These techniques are for ambitious breed of developer who are aiming for code which is: concise, elegant, robust and maintainable.

The orange book is *very* thorough, and I suspect to fully understand the ideas I'll have to learn other languages just as the author did. F# and [Haskell](2016/10/18/Learn-You-a-Haskell-for-Fun-and-Profit) are the 2 natural fits. *But* I'm going to push very hard in C# first as I know it well.

'Change the way you think is hard, and learning the syntax is relatively easy'

- Where
- OrderBy
- Any
- All
- Take
- Lambda expressions

### ReSharper

Using [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) to understand the names of different concepts and different ways of writing something  

### Euler
Did some Euler problems in a functional way ie use Linq as much as possible

[Repository of Imperative and Functional Approaches for first 17 or so](https://davemateer.visualstudio.com/_git/Euler1)  

### C# Language Skills

### Books
![ps](/assets/2019-01-11/3.png)  
[Functional Programming in C# book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp) is a very in depth book.  It took me many attempts to understand Chapter 1.
