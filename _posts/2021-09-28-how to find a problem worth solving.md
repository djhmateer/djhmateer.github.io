[previous blog on motivations]()

I'm embarking on the journey of becoming an entrepreneur as:

- Done ad-hoc consulting for 2 years (during covid) with 2 young kids and a wife with a full time academic job. Have earned not much money. But had the time to support everyone. Which has been great, but I'd like to remedy the money part.
- Have always wanted to be an entrepreneur
- It is a challenge and adventure
- Want to provide for my family
- I love the freedom of lifestyle of an entrepreneur

My strategy like programming, is to

- Research deeply - what are the canonical books on technical startup companies?
- Find people who have been successful and copy them - youtube / podcasts / blogs
- Write about it (on this blog) to help cement thinking and help others
- Rank ideas
- Landing page
- Get out of the building and talk to customers

Brainstorm ideas - I use paper and pencil so I can work in coffee shops / other places to avoid distractions. Also OneNote on my mobile phone to take notes whilst listening to a podcast out walking.

## Learning a new skill

Is hard. Frustrating. Challenging. As a good programmer, do I want to be an entrepreneur? Solopreneur? Employ people?

I'm on this path as it is hard. frustrating. challenging! Sitting at my kitchen table on a cold Wednesday morning in December listening to ZZ Top with limitless possibiliites in front on me (and my family). Exciting. When I'm sitting of my deathbed (hopefully not too soon!) I'll think of these adventures and hopefully all the people I've helped and inspired to be happy in the world.

Here are some steps in a successful company

- Build product (up to 10-20k MRR) - maybe this is a good goal for a solopreneur to start with ie same salary level as a senior programming role.
- Build business (0.5-1m ARR)
- Build company

Building product

- Shipping features
- Marketing copy
- Closing sales

Going fast in this segment is fine (veed.io quote). Tech debt is okay.

When you get to the build company part, the job of a ceo/founder is:

- set vision and communicate
- pay bills
- hire people

## Successful Tech Entrepreneurs

Like good programmers, I like to hear stories from people who have a proven track record.

[Jason Cohen, Founder, WP Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw&t=3188s) - 2013 talk.

His summary at this time (ie 2013) was

> **Predictable** acquision of customers,
> of **recurring** revenue,
> with **annual prepay**,
> in a **good market**,
> creates a **cash machine**.

My focus currently is analysing markets and finding a good fit for my company.

- Big market eg $bn
- MRR
- Be a boutique company (ie very good / fast to do things / great service)

- B2B as B2C is hard
- Not real time eg analytics, metrics, reports, monitoring, Finance, Project Mgt, Content
- Not a marketplace eg etsy, amazon, kickstarter

[MicroConf 2021 - veed.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72DjfbJNh6M) - Video editing in the browser

Impressive has gone in 2 years from 2 founders to 60 employees.

first year was growth
- mvp just doing simple things
- push hard on marketing. quora, reddit, fb groups.. almost too hard. took 6 months for seo to kick in

second year
 - give up jobs when painful and hire people


[Productised Services - MicroConf podcast](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/blair-enns-productized-services)

90,000 data points go into an airline ticket price - the point is that we need to measure everything in business.

- Customised Service (consulting)
- Productised Service - faster, more battle tested, more bang for buck
- Product

[The Agent Nest - MicroConf podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INAbsv06gMg)

- Customer Pain - smaller niche
- Competitor Pain - larger (eg docusign being expensive)

This was a nice podcast of a founder doing $8k MMR.

Interesting she has gone back to free trial (1st Dec 2021) - maybe paid trial did not work.

[Thomas Smale - FE International](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/thomas-smale-what-to-do-before-building-a-saas) 

Fascinating podcast. Mergers and Acquisitions. 

Advice on starting a SaaS

- Be patient (if you're coming from freelancing). Is personal finance okay? 2 years until full time income
- Build something you know about, and enjoy the segment. Are people willing to buy?
- Be a student of the art and science of business.

Scratch own itch. Maybe not a good idea. It must be commercially viable.

How to see if an idea is viable?
- Write content
- Engage in communities - FB, Forums, Podcast (guest or own), Social Media, Videos make (youtube)
- Landing page - we're building secret product x. Sign up on waitlist.. then wait to see if get traction

maybe build a better version of something out there

ie start to engage with market in simplest way..

- Write content eg 50 articles, and maybe 1 will get traction
- Engage in communities - podcasts, social media, youtube, blogs
- Engage with market - I see this problem.. based on my observations..

ie talk around the problems you see.

- Chances are you will pivot with company

okay now have an idea, and it seems like people may buy it. What now.

- Keep producing content
- Ship something (he said so sad to see people with products not released!)
- Don't worry about branding, names. Make it functional 
- Iterate on what paying people want.
- May first 10 customers free, then 10 bucks?

There is vast sums of money out there to buy good businesses. Eg tech engineers out of big companies wanting to buy an existing business for 100k-2m. It seems 3 or 4x Net Profit can sell a company for. With a track record. Already successful. So they can immediately start working on it (they don't want the initial risky part of entrepreneurism).

Product - buyers want a good product which will be around in 10-50 years.

Find similar companies in your area and read their blogs.

[Entrepreneur x]()

A friend who owns companies has some ideas:

- What do you know how to market? Doesn't matter if it's competite vertical.. if have a new angle
- Find an affiliate program for a similar product, then make sales
- Use that knowledge to make your own product, or identify new opportunities -
- Amazon your own products
- Become an investor
