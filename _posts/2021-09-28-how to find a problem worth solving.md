[previous blog on motivations]()

I'm embarking on the journey of becoming an entrepreneur as:

- Done ad-hoc consulting for 2 years (during covid) with 2 young kids and a wife with a full time academic job. Have earned not much money. But had the time to support everyone. Which has been great, but I'd like to remedy the money part.
- Have always wanted to be an entrepreneur
- It is a challenge and adventure
- Want to provide for my family
- I love the freedom of lifestyle of an entrepreneur

My strategy like programming, is to

- Research deeply - what are the canonical books on technical startup companies?
- Find people who have been successful and copy them - youtube / podcasts / blogs
- Write about it (on this blog) to help cement thinking and help others
- Rank ideas
- Landing page
- Get out of the building and talk to customers

Brainstorm ideas - I use paper and pencil so I can work in coffee shops / other places to avoid distractions. Also OneNote on my mobile phone to take notes whilst listening to a podcast out walking.

## Learning a new skill

Is hard. Frustrating. Challenging. As a good programmer, do I want to be an entrepreneur? Solopreneur? Employ people?

Sitting at my kitchen table on a cold Wednesday morning in December listening to ZZ Top with limitless possibiliites in front on me (and my family). Exciting. When I'm sitting of my deathbed (hopefully not too soon!) I'll think of these adventures and hopefully all the people I've helped and inspired to be happy in the world.

Here are some steps in a successful company

- Build product (up to 10-20k MRR) - maybe this is a good goal for a solopreneur to start with ie same salary level as a senior programming role.
- Build business (0.5-1m ARR)
- Build company

Building product

- Shipping features
- Marketing copy
- Closing sales

Going fast in this segment is fine (veed.io quote). Tech debt is okay.

When you get to the build company part, the job of a ceo/founder is:

- set vision and communicate
- pay bills
- hire people

## Successful Tech Entrepreneurs

Like good programmers, I like to hear stories from people who have a proven track record.

[Jason Cohen, Founder, WP Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw&t=3188s) - 2013 talk.

His summary at this time (ie 2013) was

> **Predictable** acquision of customers,
> of **recurring** revenue,
> with **annual prepay**,
> in a **good market**,
> creates a **cash machine**.

My focus currently is analysing markets and finding a good fit for my company.

- Big market eg $bn
- MRR
- Be a boutique company (ie very good / fast to do things / great service)

- B2B as B2C is hard
- Not real time eg analytics, metrics, reports, monitoring, Finance, Project Mgt, Content
- Not a marketplace eg etsy, amazon, kickstarter

[MicroConf 2021 - veed.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72DjfbJNh6M) - Video editing in the browser

Impressive has gone in 2 years from 2 founders to 60 employees.

first year was growth
- mvp just doing simple things
- push hard on marketing. quora, reddit, fb groups.. almost too hard. took 6 months for seo to kick in

second year
 - give up jobs when painful and hire people


[Productised Services - MicroConf podcast](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/blair-enns-productized-services)

90,000 data points go into an airline ticket price - the point is that we need to measure everything in business.

- Customised Service (consulting)
- Productised Service - faster, more battle tested, more bang for buck
- Product

[The Agent Nest - MicroConf podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INAbsv06gMg)

- Customer Pain - smaller niche
- Competitor Pain - larger (eg docusign being expensive)

This was a nice podcast of a founder doing $8k MMR.

Interesting she has gone back to free trial (1st Dec 2021) - maybe paid trial did not work.

[Thomas Smale - FE International](https://podcast.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/thomas-smale-what-to-do-before-building-a-saas) 

Fascinating podcast. Mergers and Acquisitions. 

Advice on starting a SaaS

- Be patient (if you're coming from freelancing). Is personal finance okay? 2 years until full time income
- Build something you know about, and enjoy the segment. Are people willing to buy?
- Be a student of the art and science of business.

Scratch own itch. Maybe not a good idea. It must be commercially viable.

How to see if an idea is viable?
- Write content
- Engage in communities - FB, Forums, Podcast (guest or own), Social Media, Videos make (youtube)
- Landing page - we're building secret product x. Sign up on waitlist.. then wait to see if get traction

maybe build a better version of something out there

ie start to engage with market in simplest way..

- Write content eg 50 articles, and maybe 1 will get traction
- Engage in communities - podcasts, social media, youtube, blogs
- Engage with market - I see this problem.. based on my observations..

ie talk around the problems you see.

- Chances are you will pivot with company

okay now have an idea, and it seems like people may buy it. What now.

- Keep producing content
- Ship something (he said so sad to see people with products not released!)
- Don't worry about branding, names. Make it functional 
- Iterate on what paying people want.
- May first 10 customers free, then 10 bucks?

There is vast sums of money out there to buy good businesses. Eg tech engineers out of big companies wanting to buy an existing business for 100k-2m. It seems 3 or 4x Net Profit can sell a company for. With a track record. Already successful. So they can immediately start working on it (they don't want the initial risky part of entrepreneurism).

Product - buyers want a good product which will be around in 10-50 years.

Find similar companies in your area and read their blogs.

[Entrepreneur x]()

A friend who owns companies has some ideas:

- What do you know how to market? Doesn't matter if it's competite vertical.. if have a new angle
- Find an affiliate program for a similar product, then make sales
- Use that knowledge to make your own product, or identify new opportunities -
- Amazon your own products
- Become an investor

[Microconf 2017 - Ben Orenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n078RDNz6jY&t=12s)

Vim guy

8 min lighting talk on Ruby at a conf

made a screencast making vim screencasts
put on shopify for $9
people started following on twitter

emailled everyone from boston ruby group - released a product
first email was transformative

screencast $10k over time

retired and its on youtube vim for rails developers

1 - Teach
how to pick a topic
  what is something from 6 months ago that would have saved you time
	what are people asking you about
	what is something that you like, that bores other people eg billing and feelancing
begin small
  - co workers.. do a lunch and learn.. 8 miute talk 
	eg on Docker
	- lightning talks
	- 60 minute google hangout
	why
	 build an authority
	   get their email!
	 get practice teaching
	 do customer research
	 ask them 
	   what problems they have
		 etc..

2 - make an info product eg ebook
  one copy to one stranger
	small is beautiful!
	 a docker crash course
	 surviving your first week with docker
	 docker for total beginners
	 docker distilled
	 docker for non programmers
	 what I wish I'd know about docker when I'd started
	 why docker sucks and what you should use instead
40 page thing is fine
recommend - get an airbnb
 4 to 5 days..!!
  get groceries
	goal: write chapter of ebook.. meaty one
	    table of contents
	sales page - maybe leanpub
	   can pre sell


Part 2 - if you've started.

1. create a recurring reminder to run a price test every 6 months.
   nothing he has done is better than changing pricing
	  eg hide cheapest tier
		  or try doubling it

2. create an email course
  eg land your dream rails job
	  drip it out over 5 days
		that converted 10% of people that signed up.. to premium product
		2 weeks of setup

3. integrate and partner
   integrated with zapier
	    then zap wrote a blog post about them
			anohter great channel

		supposed competitor - did a deal with 30% bundled together.
		   $100k over 4 days
			did big cross post deal

4. Sell annual plans
     2 months free
		 day 86...am going to bill in 4 days
		 end of FY - send email.. simplify.. annual plan.

5. Put faces near things you want clicked
     - like sign up for email
		 - or buy now
	   used to be https://upcase.com - now it is https://thoughtbot.com

6. try a diving save
   cancellation.. mostly people don't have time.
	 so the day after cancel, email saying okay.
	   how about an annual plan with a big discount, saying you'll have time, and you'll save money
		 5% people say yes

7. start a podcast
   eg podcast editing service https://castos.com/podcast-editing-service/
	  not a huge time
		great
		  people say yes to podcast interview requests
			get them to tweet

8. manually onboard customers
    ie watch customers sign up live
		 get them to sign up.
		find out what is confusing them

		email box - to get founder to email you to help onboard
		https://calendly.com/ - automated schuling
		80% success

9. double down on things that work
eg snappa
 best performing blog post page was about free stock photos which drove people away from him
 so he doubled down... so he build a free stock photo site.. which drove people back

10. ask for help
 the more successful they are the more friendly and willing to help

- How great marketing can make you fail faster
- 3 things you need to order to grow
- How to scale marketing

Email and SMS marketing for ecommerce brands [https://www.drip.com/](https://www.drip.com/)

- Build something people want (hard) - product market fit.
- Find your position
- Scale

Keep employee count down, revenue up.

They started with $50pm and $99pm

If you dont have ROT numbers, go and figure out why people are churning. It means that it isn't the right product yet.

ie only a £8k MRR.. they had 125 customers paying at least $49

email to say please spare 15seconds on why you cancelled. was too expenside

- lower price
- build more features

2/3 people don't want this.

He then replied.. saying sorry to hear this..what could we do to charge this.. what features would be good.

The filter these comments though your gut.. does it fit vision.. then talk to your mastermind (cofounder?)

Build or Not?
- Does it fit in my vision of the product?
- Will this feature matter in 2 years
- Will it grow the business?

A few months of thinking about this.

- Built a rules engines... in a few months.. then got to $11k MRR. So people wanted this rules engine. Ah - good product market fit.

How to be different

- Invent a category
- Take a position in a category
- Compare features





## Terminology

Product market fit

Revenue - aka Gross Sales, Turnover, Top Line. Is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services related to the primary operations of the business

Profit - aka Net Income, Total Earnings

Growth rate
 
Churn - frist 60 days take out.. they had 18%.. early days want it to be 10%

Trial to Conversation rate - want to be between 40 and 60% as a rule

## ROT

ROT (Credit card up front)
- Visit to Trial: 0.7%-2%... with low credit card eg 10-20bucks should be higher eg 1.5-2%
- Trail to Paid: 40-60%
- First 60/90 day churn: 20-40%
- Post 60/90: 4-7%
