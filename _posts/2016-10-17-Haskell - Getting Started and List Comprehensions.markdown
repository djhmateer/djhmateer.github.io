<p>....Because trying something new is fun!</p>

## What is Haskell?
* Functional -  Given the arguments, always returns the same output ie no global or local state. 
* Lazy
* Statically typed

## Learn you a Haskell
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) the goal of the reading group is to get through this book.

<p>Week 1 is about</p>
* Getting Started
* Lists (and list comprehension)

## Getting started
* [Download Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html) Minimal x86
* [VS Code Text Editor](http://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Haskell Syntax Highlighting

## REPL

<p>Running from Powershell GIT in windows</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "world"
greeting = string1 ++ string2

-- * is an infix function which takes 2 numbers and multiplies (as opposed to a prefix)
a = 49 * 100

doubleMe x = x + x

-- 6
b = doubleMe 3

-- 16.6  as + works on ints and floating-point numbers
c = doubleMe 8.3

## Euler 1
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is where I start when learning a new language to flex my new 'toolbelt'..

<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
-- 1.  Head of list
a = head [1,2,3]
-- 2,3.  Tail of the list
b = tail [1,2,3]
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight haskell %}
-- List comprehension (output function is before the pipe)
-- x 'such that' 
-- filtering (weeding out lists by predicates)
h = sum [x | x <- [1..999], x `mod` 3 == 0 || x `mod` 5 == 0]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>running the function h to get the answer.  Reloading  changes :r  in file euler.hs</p>

## Euler 2
Come back to this.. recursion and zipWith concepts

## Euler 3
<p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
 What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p>

{% highlight haskell %}
-- Euler 3
-- The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
-- What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

-- number is prime if only divisible by 1 and itself
-- http://stackoverflow.com/a/5811176/26086
-- eg if checking isPrime 12
-- 3 * 4 are factors
-- 2 * 6 are factors..
-- one of the factors has to be less than the sqrt
-- and if there is a factor, then it isn't a prime
-- only need check up to the sqrt of number to see if it can be divided with remainder of 0

-- getting the square root as an int
-- x 35 = 5
-- x 144 = 12
x num = floor (sqrt (fromIntegral num))

-- If result set is empty isPrime = True
isPrime num = [x | x <- [2..floor (sqrt (fromIntegral num))], num `mod` x == 0] == []

-- The factors of a number 
facs num =  [x | x <- [3..num], num `mod` x  == 0]
-- [5,7,13,29,35,65,91,145,203,377,455,1015,1885,2639,13195]
q = facs 13195

-- Prime factors
facs' num =  [x | x <- [3..num], num `mod` x  == 0, isPrime x]
-- [5,7,13,29]
q' = facs' 13195

-- Problem is that it doesn't stop after giving the correct answer
-- as its checking all the way up to 600851475143 to see if its a factor
-- [71,839,1471,6857]
r = facs' 600851475143

-- only need to check up to sqrt of 600851475143 to see if it's a factor and a prime
facs'' num =  [x | x <- [3..floor(sqrt (fromIntegral num))], num `mod` x  == 0, isPrime x]
s = facs'' 600851475143

## Euler 4
{% highlight haskell %}
-- Euler 4
-- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
-- The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
-- Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

-- [4,3,2,1]
u = reverse [1,2,3,4]

-- int to string
v = show 345
-- string to int
w = read "345" :: Int

-- can reverse the string (as it is a list of chars really)
u' = reverse "1234"
z = reverse v

-- 9009
t = maximum [x*y | x <- [10..99], y <- [10..99], isPalindrome (x*y)]
-- int to string, reverse int to string ie compare 2 strings
isPalindrome num = show num == reverse (show num) 

-- 906609
t' = maximum [x*y | x <- [100..999], y <- [100..999], isPalindrome (x*y)]
{% endhighlight %}

## _ and Tuples
{% highlight haskell %}
-- implementing own version of length (of a list)
-- _ means we don't care what we draw from the list.
-- replace every element of a list with 1, then sum
length' xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs] 

-- 4
o = length' [1,2,3,4]

-- Tuple can contain several types
-- returns first component of the Tuple
-- 8
p = fst (8,11) 
-- "Wow"
q = fst ("Wow", False)

-- Which right triangle that has integers for all sides and all sides equal to or 
-- smaller than 10 has a perimeter of 24?
-- a^2 + b^2 = c^2
-- eg 3,4,5 triangle.. perimeter = 12
-- 9 + 16 = 25

-- generate numbers for all sides returning a Tuple
-- [(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]
r = [(a,b,c) | a <- [1..10], b <- [1..10], c <- [1..10], a^2 + b^2 == c^2, a+b+c==24]

{% endhighlight %}

## Summary of toolbelt so far
{% highlight haskell %}
-- List comprehension (output function is before the pipe)
-- filtering (weeding out lists by predicates)
a = [x*2 | x <- [1..10], odd x, x > 3]
{% endhighlight %}
