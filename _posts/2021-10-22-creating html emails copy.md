HTML emails are a strange beast. You need to inline all the CSS, and there are edge cases (Outlook!) to take care of.

To get going fast here are resources I found useful.

[https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/activate-your-spothero-account](https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/activate-your-spothero-account) - samples people have uploaded

[https://stripo.email/](https://stripo.email/) Build your own and templates.

[https://email.uplers.com/blog/step-step-guide-create-html-email/](https://email.uplers.com/blog/step-step-guide-create-html-email/)


[https://htmlemail.io/inline/](https://htmlemail.io/inline/) - useful to check if it renders!

## End Result

I used an email template from stripo as a baseline and modified the underlying html.

I'm happy to have a good looking email
