SEO has always felt like snake oil to me.

But is it?

Here are some of core tenants of SEO:

- Make the site fast.
- Have content with headings and words that people are searching for
- Have other people talking about your pages 

This all seems to be fairly common sense and good practise.

## Make Site Fast

A good tool to use is PageSpeed insights (which uses lighthouse under the hood which can be found in Chrome Developer tools)

[https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

Aim to get around 90. However interestingly [https://www.bbc.co.uk/](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) is getting a low score (on the google.com tool) so take we need to use common sense. On the Chrome tool it is reporting much better. Probably due to international redirects to bbc.com


Not tricky.

- Reduce image sizes
- Get rid of assets you don't need on a page (eg loading js and css you don't need)
- Use static pages so don't need to worry about database hits and server processing

### Reduce image sizes

At it's simplest, there is no need to have massive images downloaded. Put some effort into making them smaller.

### Reduce assets

If you don't need some js on a page (eg form validation js) then don't load it.

This is easier said than done when using CMS's eg WordPress with large plugins eg 

### Use a service for caching/perf/analytics eg CloudFlare

can even use a subdomain eg test.davemateer.com to see what the perf difference is by putting a service in front of you domain

They have a Wordpress optimisation plugin which could be a very easy quick win.

### Wordpress - Minimise http requests and caching and

## Content

What are people searching for

Make the content high up on the site

copyrighter
  rewriting stuff what people are looking for
 need to make sure the content is good is written with the words people are searching for
  what services are
   what peope are seraching for
  look in google ad words
     so can tell what peoplel are serach for

### Content Strategy
Write news articles which are focussed on what clients asked about and the problems they experienced.

precises of the latest 3 news items on every page of the site?


## Back links

Do good marketing! Eg we have [https://www.wiredsussex.com/](https://www.wiredsussex.com/) which is about promoting the technology sector across Sussex.

Do a press release. 

Linked In and linked in pulse 

Connect with local businesses


## Broken Links

I would guess this is important not to have broken links in your site.

## Long term strategy

Write every week on your speciality.



## Other information

I've been making site crawlers for years. This is a fascinating area, and it looks like a lot of opportunity.
