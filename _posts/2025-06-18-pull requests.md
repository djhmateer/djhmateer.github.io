Here are some things I've learned about the etiquette of pull requests in opensource, as compared to working on your own code bases.

Sometime you try things, and learn the hard way what others expect.

Working with others is a good learning opportunity to improve one's coding style

## Getting a PR ready

I had a ton of updates to do to a project, and I think it works best if they are done consistently, with small updates, over time.

This is not the case for many projects, where maintainers and committers often go in bursts of work. Much harder than commerical coding.

## Before submitting a PR

Read Coding guidelines for a project

Keep PR's small

Make a PR a good one ie should be ready to merge into the codebase.

Take out comments eg I like in dev to put in DM 18th Jun 2025.... comment.

Put in additional information via commits


Don't leave in copied information (even though it may be useful in the future)



## How to have a conversation

Naming is hard! It would have been better to have a conversation before submitting this PR to save the maintainer the headspace.

He has renamed it 'json_enricher' which is fine.


## Small PRs

Would be much easier.

and do it per feature.
