[I've been using Vim in anger for 3 years now](/2018/02/21/VIM) and have recently [found a way to use it with my favourite note taking application OneNote](/2020/04/10/OneNote-with-Vim) so I thought I'd revisit my favourite most used commands and learn some more the the process.

- VS Code
- Visual Studio Plugin
- OneNote

Here are my most used commands

```bash

CapsLock - mapped to escape
h,j,k,l - move up, down, left, right
o - start writing on next line
dd - delete a line
. - repeat deleting a line
i - insert
gg - go to top of document
G - go to end of document
yy - yank line

v - visual mode (for copying)

ci( - change inside ()
di( - delete inside ()

J - join next line to this one
~ - capitalise

fw - find lettter w

A - go to end of line and start inserting


```

Here are my lesser used commands:

```bash
I - insert at beginnning of line
```

## _vimrc

asf

```bash

```

## Keyboard repeat set faster

This is very useful to make navigation feel more responsive eg h,j,k,l and also repeat .
