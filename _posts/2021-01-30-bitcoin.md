Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)

## History

[![My card 7970](/assets/2021-01-27/msi.jpg "7970"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-01-27/msi.jpg)

I've got 2 of these cards which were bought back around April 2013 for Bitcoin mining.
[Here are my archive programgood.net articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20170701030000/http://www.programgood.net/CategoryView,category,Bitcoin.aspx) from that time.

In 30th April 2013 I did 18 hours of processing on both of these cards earning 0.02709333 BTC = £2.53

1.5 years later 0.02703604 BTC = £9.31 (at 1BTC = 584USD)

In late Jan 2021 1BTC = $33,968 0.02709333 BTC = £671

Now on the 11th Feb 2021 = £870 at $44,475

Now on the 19th Feb 2021 = £1000 at $51,696

## Slushpool

[https://slushpool.com/dashboard/](https://slushpool.com/dashboard/?c=btc) is where I did my mining


## Wallets

[https://www.blockchain.com/](https://www.blockchain.com/)

use their trading wallet to avoid high fees. They have a mobile app

They have 2FA and also a Secret Private Key Recovery Phrase

[https://www.coinbase.com/](https://www.coinbase.com/) is another place to buy and sell (maybe a wallet too?)

## Bitcoin Address

Every time I request money it will be to a different bitcoin Address. This will come to my Blockchain wallet.

## Buy more BTC

Lets buy $10 of crypto

0.00021769BTC at BTC of $45,985 and world market is $44,674 currently

I ended up with:

0.00021306

And interestingly: You will not be able to Send or Withdraw these funds from your Wallet for the next 3 days

## Swap / Transfer money out of blockchain

If I want to get money onto my GBP Credit card I need to setup a GBP Cash Wallet in Blockchain.

I need to put in my personal details to comply with local laws.


## Buy Crypto

It is very easy to bit bitcoin through blockchain - just type in your credit card and it work


## Other currencies

[Etherium]()
