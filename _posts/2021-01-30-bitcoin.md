## History

I've got 2 of these cards which were bought back around April 2013 for Bitcoin mining.

In 30th April 2013 I did 18 hours of processing on both of these cards earning 

0.02709333 BTC = £2.53

1.5 years later

0.02703604 BTC = £9.31 (at 1BTC = 584USD)

In 2021 1BTC = 33,968USD

0.02709333 BTC = £671

## Wallets

[https://www.blockchain.com/](https://www.blockchain.com/) - use their trading wallet to avoid high fees. They have a mobile app

They have 2FA and also a Secret Private Key Recovery Phrase

Every time I request money it will be to a different bitcoin Address. This will come to my Blockchain wallet.
