I'm writing a broken link checker, and after fixing my blog and doing lots of crawls it gets frustrating waiting for it to complete. So I need

- To have simultaneous connections
- Be smart and not Ddos target servers

## Using Task to get multuiple connections

[This example comes from MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/start-multiple-async-tasks-and-process-them-as-they-complete)

```cs
static async Task Main()
{
    var httpClient = new HttpClient();

    var urlList = SetUpURLList();

    List<Task<(int length, long elapsedMilliseonds)>> downloadTasks = urlList.Select(
        url =>
        {
            return ProcessURL(url, httpClient);
        }).ToList();

    // ***Add a loop to process the tasks one at a time until none remain.
    while (downloadTasks.Count > 0)
    {
        // Identify the first task that completes.
        Task<(int length, long elapsedMilliseconds)> firstFinishedTask = await Task.WhenAny(downloadTasks);

        // ***Remove the selected task from the list so that you don't
        // process it more than once.
        downloadTasks.Remove(firstFinishedTask);

        // Await the completed task.
        var (length, elapsedMilliseconds) = await firstFinishedTask;

        // add a new task - okay this seems to work.
        //downloadTasks.Add(ProcessURL("https://davemateer.com", httpClient));

        Console.WriteLine($"Length of download: {length} in {elapsedMilliseconds}ms");
    }
}

static async Task<(int length, long elapsedMilliseconds)> ProcessURL(string url, HttpClient client)
{
    var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    var httpResponseMessage = await client.GetAsync(url);

    // Retrieve the website contents from the HttpResponseMessage.
    byte[] urlContents = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsByteArrayAsync();

    return (urlContents.Length, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
}

private static List<string> SetUpURLList() =>
    new List<string>
    {
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com",
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211380.aspx",
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh290136.aspx",
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd470362.aspx",
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa578028.aspx",
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms404677.aspx",
        "https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff730837.aspx"
    };
```

I'm not passing a cancellation token (yet), and have commented out a line to add another task while still in the loop which works.

I think this WhenAny solution is appropriate but [if there are too many tasks on the queue](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/processing-tasks-as-they-complete/) then it may not be. I'm going to limit the number of tasks for a different reason below.

## Limiting the tasks

A simlple solution is to limit the number of tasks added to the list:

```cs
// if there are already 2 queries waiting don't put any more on the downloadTasks list
if (downloadTasks.Count > 2)
    await Task.Delay(500);
else
    // add a new task
    downloadTasks.Add(ProcessURL("https://davemateer.com", httpClient));
```

However I want to be smarter:

- Only have
