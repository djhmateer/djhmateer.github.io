I've used Cyberduck for years as an S3 viewer for files in Digital Ocean spaces. The main problme has been selecting a large number of files and downloading them.

## S3 Browser

Download To - is not avaiable in the free version.


## rclone

[https://rclone.org/](https://rclone.org/)

```bash
# 1.71.0 on 15th Sept 25
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

# gui is the web browser (but prefer command line)
rclone rcd --rc-web-gui

#~/config/rclone/rclone.conf
[first-project]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXXXXX
secret_access_key = XXXXX
region = fra1
endpoint = fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com

# list bucket davetesting
rclone lsd first-project:davetesting

# copy (doesn't delete any extra files at destination)
rclone copy first-project:davetesting /mnt/f/Backups/DigitalOcean/davetesting --progress

# make sure destination folder exists (will create automatically)
# 8.6GB test - a single 4GB file in there
# doing 4 files at a time
# maxing out my USB HDD

# it wont copy again if file is already there (looking at time within 2secs worked for me)
rclone copy first-project:autoarchiverfeatures /mnt/f/Backups/DigitalOcean/autoarchiverfeatures --progress --modify-window 2s

# 40k files
# fast-list if 10k more files - gets a flat list. Less API requests. More RAM usage locally.
rclone copy first-project:aademomain /mnt/f/Backups/DigitalOcean/aademomain --progress --modify-window 2s --fast-list


```



## Todo List for Blog Post

- [ ] Add proper title and structure for S3 storage explorers comparison
- [ ] Document Cyberduck performance issues with large file counts
- [ ] Research GUI S3 tools that handle large file counts better
- [ ] Explore filesystem mounting options for S3 (Windows Explorer/Mac Finder integration)
- [ ] Compare performance and usability of different S3 tools
