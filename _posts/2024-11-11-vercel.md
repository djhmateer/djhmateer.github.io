I'm exploring a new stack

- React / Next.js
- Vercel
- Supabase

So I can 

- work on this professionaly for a client
- put my company website [https://hmsoftware.co.uk/](https://www.hmsoftware.co.uk/) onto a TailwindCSS template which uses Next.js
- create marketing emails using [https://react.email/](https://react.email/)

## Hosting on Vercel

First impressions as a 'hobbyist' level is that the UI is great and just works when I connected my GH account.

Turn off Deployment Protection so anyone can see the site. 

## Domains

[https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain)

Very interesting that vercel recommend adding a redirect to the www name and not the apex. [deatils](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/working-with-domains#apex-domain)

Also interesting they don't use a CNAME like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) do (this is my [dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com/) DNS interface before I made the A record change to vercel)

Updated

## SSL Cert

Vercel generates one using LetsEncrypt. It took some minutes. A good integration.


## Limits

[https://vercel.com/pricing](https://vercel.com/pricing)

Pro is $20 per user/month.

- Custom Domains 50 (Hobby)
- Data Transfer 100GB per month (Hobby), 1TB (Pro)
- Edge Requests (ie every request) 1M per month, 10M per month.
- 1000 images per month, 5000 per month

On the Pro side there are alerts on spending and overages. And you can turn off the site if it hits it so [Netlify horror story](https://answers.netlify.com/t/netlify-billing-horror-story/113392) one doesn't get a massive bill if there is a DDoS.

## Web Analytics

- 2,500 events/month on hobby
- 1 month history

## Speed Insights

Just js injected into the page - like google one.

## Firewall

[![alt text](/assets/2024-11-11/3.jpg "email")](/assets/2024-11-11/3.jpg)


Real time and up to 1 day of traffic on hobby.


## Conclusion

After a few days I'm very impressed.
