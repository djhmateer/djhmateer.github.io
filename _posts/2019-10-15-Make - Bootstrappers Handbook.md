[Make - Bootstrappers Handbook](2019/10/15/Make-Bootstrappers-Handbook) by [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio), who launched products such as [remoteok](https://remoteok.io/) which lets you search for remote jobs, and [nomadlist](https://nomadlist.com/).

His book is a 'brain dump' and he is candid about his failures. His first piece of advice is:

> **Always Keep Shipping**

This seems to be a commonality amongst startup entrepreneurs - just do it and learn along the way, as getting stuff out there is massive.

## Idea

This section is about:

- Coming up with ideas
- Qualifying them

He suggest **solving your own problems** first and thinking small.

Also your passion to industry.
