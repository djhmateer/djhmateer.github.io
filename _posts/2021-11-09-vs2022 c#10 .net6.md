TL;DR

waiting for Ubuntu bits to drop

then need to wire up serilog (see below)

## VS2022

Installed VS Vim Extension

Changed font from `Cascadia Mono 10` to `Consolas 10`

Installed R# [https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/nextversion/#section=windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/nextversion/#section=windows) 2021.3.EAP7 - 8th Nov 2021. This has support for VS2022 which seems to be working well.

## C# 10

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10)

C# 10 is supported on .NET 6 LTS.

### Implicit Namespaces

```cs
// Program.cs
// yes.. all of it!

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapRazorPages();

app.Run();
```

Very impressive we've lost all the usings at the top. I love the simplicity.

Interestingly we've lost the `startup.cs` class too, which I guess it good, but will need to figure out how to get `serilog` working.


### File Scope Namespace

```cs
// Don't need nested {} anymore
namespace WebApplication9.Pages;

public class ErrorModel : PageModel
{
    public string? RequestId { get; set; }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier;
    }
}
```

### Hot Reload

Super handy keeping the browser window open and doing code and html changes which are updates when I save the file `Ctrl S` in VS.


## Razor Pages

Where has `Startup.cs` gone?

Included `bootstrap 5.1.0` and current version as of 9th Nov 2021 is `5.1.3` 

## Starup.cs

## Linux SDK

Looks like getting .NET6 on Ubuntu is not quite ready yet.

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu)


[https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/26879](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/26879) install packages not quite there yet (9th Feb)

install docs from GH source [https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/docs/core/install/linux-ubuntu.md#2110-](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/docs/core/install/linux-ubuntu.md#2110-)
