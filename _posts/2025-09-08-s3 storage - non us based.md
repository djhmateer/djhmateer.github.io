## S3 Storage Providers to Try

- [ ] OVH S3 storage - test performance and compatibility
- [ ] Hetzner S3 storage - test performance and compatibility
- [ ] Research and compare costings between providers
- [ ] Compare long term vs short term storage options (SSD vs HDD)


## Hetzner (Germany)

Object Storage announced in Dec 2024.

5.99Euro/month - regardless of how many buckets you have
 1TB-hour of included storage
 1.5GB traffic per hour (1TB per month)

 ingress is free

Will send me a recovery key for 2FA in the post if I lose mine. Have to use my authenticator on mobile phone or to remove 2FA I have keys in password storage.

## OVH (France)

1-AZ (ie not multi zone redundancey) zone on HDD. at around 10-12Euro or Â£7 per TB/month
