Here I show starting a brand new web application project using AI assistance to guide us through the process and keep on point. 

In 2 hours we had a 1 page plan (ie Press Release and FAQ) as to what the project does for the end custumer.

Then a few hours after that we had GH repo, and a list of tasks on where to start.

# ü™∂ Lightweight PR/FAQ (2-Person Version)

## ‚úÖ Step 1: PR/FAQ  
Defines the **customer, problem, and vision** ‚Äî already done.

---

## üß© Step 2: Mini FAQ (1 Page)

Answer these five:

1. **MVP Goal** ‚Äì Smallest version proving demand.  
   _Ex:_ ‚ÄúMap of 10 verified parks.‚Äù

2. **Data Source** ‚Äì Where info comes from.  
   _Ex:_ ‚ÄúOpenStreetMap + manual checks.‚Äù

3. **Tech Stack** ‚Äì Tools you know best.  
   _Ex:_ ‚ÄúFastAPI + Postgres + Tailwind + Leaflet.‚Äù

4. **Metrics** ‚Äì Proof it‚Äôs working.  
   _Ex:_ ‚Äú10 users weekly, 20 reviews.‚Äù

5. **Risks** ‚Äì What might block use.  
   _Ex:_ ‚ÄúBad data, poor UX, no motivation.‚Äù

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Build MVP

- **Skip Figma** ‚Äî code directly.  
- Focus: map, detail page, dual ratings, tick-off.  
- Keep **static**; aim for **1‚Äì2 week prototype**.

---

## üß™ Step 4: Test

- Get **3‚Äì5 local users**.  
- Watch without guiding.  
- Fix only what blocks usage.




## 1.PR/FAQ

Press Release and Frequently Asked Questions.

PR/FAQs describe a product from the perspective of the launch day ‚Äì the difference here is, it hasn't been created.

> We innovate by starting with the customer and working backwards. That becomes the touchstone for how we invent. ‚Äì Jeff Bezos

## SpotScore - Skatepark finder for parents

I started with a prompt and asked chatgpt5 to ask me questions as I went along:

`please use the PR/FAQ https://productstrategy.co/working-backwards-the-amazon-prfaq-for-product-innovation/ strategy from amazon (also https://workingbackwards.com/resources/working-backwards-pr-faq/) to ask me questions on a new product idea called spotscore which helps parents find the best local skateparks - which are rated by kids and parents.`


after which we iterated and got a doc:

# 2. SpotScore ‚Äî Internal FAQ (v1)

## Overview
SpotScore is a lightweight, community web app that helps parents and kids find and rate local skateparks.  
This Internal FAQ defines what‚Äôs *in scope* for the MVP, what success looks like, and how we‚Äôll build and validate it.

---

## 1. MVP Goal
**What‚Äôs the smallest version that proves people want this?**

> A web app showing a map of ~10 verified skateparks around Lewes, East Sussex ‚Äî each with dual ratings (parent/kid), basic amenity info, and a ‚Äúvisited‚Äù tick-off.

**Core MVP features**
- Interactive map with clickable park markers  
- Park detail page with:
  - Name, description, and location  
  - Parent rating (facilities/safety)  
  - Kid rating (fun factor)  
  - Amenities (parking, toilets, caf√©s)  
- Simple login (optional) for rating and tick-off  
- Mobile-first, responsive UI
---

## 2. Data & Content
**Where does initial data come from?**
- OpenStreetMap (for coordinates and names)  
- Local council datasets  
- Manual verification (visiting or confirming locations)  
- Optional crowd-sourced suggestions (after MVP launch)

**How is it maintained?**
- Small manual updates by the founders  
- Add ‚Äúsuggest a correction‚Äù option later  
- Track all sources in a single CSV or Postgres table for transparency

**Data freshness target:** update each park at least once per year.

---

## 3. Technical Stack

| Layer | Tool / Tech |
|-------|--------------|
| Backend | **FastAPI** (Python) |
| Database | **Postgres** (self-hosted, managed VM) |
| Frontend | **Tailwind CSS + HTML/JS** (or minimal React if needed) |
| Map | **Leaflet** + **OpenStreetMap** tiles |
| Hosting | Self-hosted VM (Ubuntu, nginx, HTTPS via Caddy or Certbot) |
| Auth | Minimal email link / session cookie |
| Deploy | Git + rsync or lightweight CI/CD |

**Design principles**
- Keep it fast, simple, and readable on mobile  
- Avoid heavy dependencies or vendor lock-in  
- Build static where possible; dynamic only for ratings

---

## 4. Metrics & Validation

| Metric | Target (MVP phase) | Why it matters |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Parks listed | 10‚Äì15 | Completeness for local users |
| Active family users | 20+ per week | Core engagement |
| Reviews submitted | 50+ (25 parent + 25 kid) | Community trust |
| Amenity data accuracy | ‚â•80% verified | Data reliability |
| Time-to-first-park-view | <5 seconds | Fast, usable experience |

**Qualitative goals**
- Parents say ‚Äúthis saved me time choosing where to go‚Äù  
- Kids enjoy discovering new parks  
- Families revisit the site weekly

---

## 5. Risks & Assumptions

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Low user engagement (few reviews) | Medium | Launch directly in parent groups; seed initial reviews manually |
| Data inaccuracies | Medium | Manual verification + clear ‚ÄúReport issue‚Äù button |
| Poor mobile UX | Medium | Test early with parents on phones |
| Technical overhead | Low | Keep backend simple; few moving parts |
| Privacy sensitivity (kids‚Äô data) | Low | No tracking, no personal data from kids, parent-moderated accounts |

---

## 6. Growth & Next Steps

**Phase 1 (Lewes MVP)**  
- Manually seed 10 parks  
- Share with local FB parent groups  
- Collect initial reviews and feedback  

**Phase 2 (Sussex Expansion)**  
- Add 30‚Äì50 new parks  
- Introduce ‚ÄúSuggest a park‚Äù form  
- Consider light gamification (‚ÄúVisit all 10 parks‚Äù badge)

**Phase 3 (Sustainability)**  
- Explore council or shop partnerships  
- Optional ad-free sponsorships (local caf√©s/skate shops)  
- Potential nationwide directory (2026)

---

## 7. Guiding Principles

- **Small, Simple, Local** ‚Äî Focus on Lewes until the experience feels magical.  
- **Parents First** ‚Äî Prioritise trust, safety, and clarity.  
- **Community over Virality** ‚Äî Build slowly with genuine local use.  
- **Speed over Perfection** ‚Äî Ship small, iterate weekly.

## 3.Build the MVP

this is good as it gives a realistic timeframe (ie 4 weeks) to develop something
