We have good days.. and bad days.

This lockdown over winter in the UK has felt much harder.

I wrote about [The first lockdown](/2020/05/20/covid-19-lockdown-coping-as-a-family) in May 2020 when it was Spring time. 


Let's write about the fun things first that we do with our kids (Henry is 4, and Mia is 6)

## Kids TV and Films

[My Little Pony](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70234440) on Netflix. Both kids adore this! Parents don't.

[Super Wings](https://www.netflix.com/Kids/search?q=super%20wings&jbv=80196221) Henry likes

[Pixels](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pixels-Adam-Sandler/dp/B012TWNTFE/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=pixels&qid=1613298473&s=instant-video&sr=1-1) Henry loves

Having Netflix and Amazon Prime video has been great. We have an [Amazon Fire TV stick](https://www.amazon.co.uk/all-new-fire-tv-stick-with-alexa-voice-remote-includes-tv-controls-dolby-atmos-audio-2020-release/dp/B07ZZW3KJY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1PKMU1LXNHBJG&dchild=1&keywords=fire+tv+stick&qid=1613298590&s=amazon-devices&sprefix=fore+tv%2Camazon-devices%2C187&sr=1-1) rather than using any smart tv features.

Other films are: How to Train Your Dragon series


## Kids Kindle Fires

We've got 2 [Kindle Fire tablets](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-7-Kids-Edition---Black-Blue---16-GB/dp/B07H8XTGFN/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=Kindle+Fire+Tablets&qid=1613298696&sr=8-8) which are a few years old. 

We don't subscribe to [Amazon Kids plus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ftu/home) and prefer to manage exactly what is on them:

[![Manage](/assets/2021-02-14/manage.jpg "Manage"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/manage.jpg)

The top games at the moment are:

[Red Ball 4](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FDG-Entertainment-GmbH-Co-KG-Ball/dp/B012DOMCL0) - I paid the £2 to unlock all the levels. Best money ever spent.

[Paper Toss 2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BNA-Apps-Paper-Toss-2/dp/B077KFC47K/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=paper+toss&qid=1613294028&s=mobile-apps&sr=1-1) - thanks for the recommendation Caio

And bbc iPlayer is on them where they can watch

- Hey Duggie
- Numberblocks


## Kids Games

A big hit recently has been [Fantasy Retro Top Trumps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075FTHSQZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

[![Top trumps](/assets/2021-02-14/ttrumps.jpg "Top Trumps"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/ttrumps.jpg)

Chess (Mia who is 6 knows how all the pieces move and likes it!)

[![Chess](/assets/2021-02-14/chess.jpg "Chess"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/chess.jpg)

Snakes and Ladders

[![Snakes and Ladders](/assets/2021-02-14/snakes.jpg "Snakes and Ladders"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/snakes.jpg)

## Quotes and Thoughts

I pride myself on being calm under pressure, and being an optimist! But recenly I've been:

- Gloomy
- Short fuse


Getting internally furious when I ask the kids not to do something.. then they do it.. whilst looking at you with utmost defiance.


A quote I heard recently:
> The main thing is that I just get bored...
> (people with no kids)
> they can go and .....
> ahhhhhhhh!!!

## Snacking

We're trying to have 3 proper meals per day, and only some snacks at certain times.



Can I have a snack….

Please don't empty the sweets out on the floor

they empty sweets out

ahhhhhh!


Snacks
 pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese
  pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese
just one more

Just another.. just just just another....

## Listening

[![Tree](/assets/2021-02-14/tree.jpg "Tree"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/tree.jpg)

Yes kids.. if you stomp on the flowers after me telling you multiple times not to.. you have to stand against the tree and think about your actions.

Ahhhhh!!!!


## Home schooling


Have a schedule!




Home schooling is ...
Like drawing blood out of a stone


M getting very teary
  emotional
not wanting to do any school work
not wanting to be on the Teams calls

Teachers being super supportive

[![Bo](/assets/2021-02-14/bo.jpg "Getting outside"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/bo.jpg)

Getting outside and having playtime is super important (for us)

Kids getting very grumpy
  lots of whining

Going to local playpark

  identifying plants

  great as the kids can run around, shout, scream, and I'm over the other side of the field
 serendipity if other kids are there they can play


## Keeping Sane

I've been pulling out all the stops. Sometimes it doesn't work and I get very gloomy.

These are my tactics:

- Get outside
- Sport
- Walking
- Running - [strava.com](https://www.strava.com/) is fun to see what routes people do locally. And to record what you do. I run carrying my phone and have the strava app running.

[![Night run](/assets/2021-02-14/night.jpg "Night run"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/night.jpg)

Escaping for a run after dark. It was blissful.

- Meditate - I used [https://www.headspace.com/](https://www.headspace.com/) and we have a family membership which gives 6 people access.

Write a diary

Help other people


## Video Games for Grown ups

I'm not a gamer, but thought it would be fun to try.

[War thunder (free)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/236390/War_Thunder/)

I haven't played video games since I was a kid. Fun.


## Celebrate the small things

## Facts

[https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/)

[![Chart](/assets/2020-02-14/chart.jpg "Chart"){:width="800px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/chart.jpg)

Huge numbers (up to 49k on average) of people got the virus recently. Hospitals have had a similar large influx of people as first lockdown. Deaths have been similar.

Currently (13th Feb 2021) there are 

- 13.5m people who have had the 1st dose vaccination
- -1.5m have had the 2nd dose


## Brewing Beer - new hobby

[![Beer](/assets/2021-02-14/beer.jpg "Ice"){:width="500px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/beer.jpg)

I've never tried brewing beer before. I wonder how hard can it be? As of writing I've got 1 more week to go before I can drink it!

[Brewing beer blog](https://homebrewbeer.netlify.app/2021/01/how-to-get-started-home-brewing-beer-beer-from-a-kit/) is a blog I started to document it.

## Work

[![Office](/assets/2021-02-14/office.jpg "Office"){:width="600px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/office.jpg)

Having a nice home office with plants, good monitors and keyboard.. all ready to go. You can see Ellie's mac keyboard on the desk to the left.

We split each day between mornings and afternoons, then the following day the reverse. It is hard, but seems to work. 

We agree a schedule each week and have a google shared calendar 


## Nice Stuff

[Get a weekend newspaper delivered!](https://www.lewesnewspapers.com/new-customers)

Give your partner a lie in!

[Read books - I like goodreads.com to recommend](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7223629-dave-mateer)

[Meditate]() every day

Get outside every day

Have time for yourself every day with no pressure to do stuff.



## Outro

Sometimes I wonder if one of the best things about lockdown is the forced simplicity of life. 

Having time to play, explore, and not be rushing around all the time.

[![Ice](/assets/2021-02-14/ice.jpg "Ice"){:width="600px"}](/assets/2021-02-14/ice.jpg)

The amount of joy gained from picking up ice, smashing it, jumping on it.. is not to be underestimated :-)

Don't Panic!

Take care xxx
