Why people use emoji's escapes me, or it did, until I started using them for fast conversation and txt messaging.

[A friend of mine](https://ohare.blog/) pointed me to the [emoji support on a Jekyll hosted blogs](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) which has over 1.5million downloads from [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/jemoji)

So to use an emoji you use this syntax in the markdown:

```bash
I give this plugin two :+1:!
```

I give this plugin two :+1:!

## How to install

Add the following to your site's `Gemfile` or if you are using the `github-pages` plugin in the Gemfile, don't add it (as it is already there)

```bash
gem 'jemoji'
```

And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`

```yml
plugins:
  - jemoji
```

Then I followed my blog post instructions on [updating Jekyll](/2018/01/25/Jekyll-and-Docker#updating-jekyll) which got the dependency

```bash
docker run --rm -v=%cd%:/srv/jekyll -it jekyll/jekyll /bin/bash
bundle update
```

## Local Testing

Developing locally the image urls were broken and looked like:
[https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png)

On live they worked looking like:  
[https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4ee.png](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4ee.png)

so in the `_config.yml` file I put in:

```yml
emoji:
  src: "https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/"
```
