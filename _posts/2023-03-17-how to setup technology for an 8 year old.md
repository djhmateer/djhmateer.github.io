..and a 6 year old!
<!-- ![alt text](/assets/2022-11-03/2.jpg "email")](/assets/2022-11-03/2.jpg) -->

- teach kids technology by letting them play and explore (and getting out their way)
- make it fun to play with tech!
- do it in the living room/kitchen so I can keep an eye on things
- they have chat to each other if need help (social)

## Online Safety

Our school organised an Online Child Safety talk by [Paul Platts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-platts-643b801b/) where the biggest takeaways I had were:

- 'Is not a technology issue' ie we have to sit down with kids and listen to them, and make sure they are happy and safe (and are safely exploring)


- Review what the kids have been doing to help keep them safe (look at their browser history / dashboard from amazon parents / google / apple)

- Be a role model ie don't look at our devices all the time (no phones at dinner table / checking work emails all the time)


## What Tech we have

In order of how much used...

- Old Laptop per kid. Used to watch youtube and play browser games

- PS3 games console hooked up to the TV in living room. 99% of the time used to play minecraft.

- 1 fire stick on our TV with Netflix kids profile set to PG rated.

- Kindle Fire per kid - useful to watch movies on long car journey with headphones - [these ones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01A5RKRV4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- 1 Old Apple iPod which is used to listen to audio books (Audible is good for buying them). 

- 4 amazon Alexa's around the house with explicit filtering turned on for music. 1 linked spotify account (Premium Individual). Used for listening to music in kitchen. audio books in bedroom.


## Our 'Rules' 

30 minutes of screen time per day on school days. They decide what to do, and when to use the screen time.

## YouTube

My son (6) and daughter (8) love YouTube especially watching people play Minecraft!

so that they don't see things which are not age appropriate like jump scares, swear words, grown up stuff..


There are a few ways to do this

- let the kids watch without youtube beig signed in. not good as have full unrestricted access to youtube
- sign in as yourself and turn on restricted mode. not a bad simple solution
- use youtubekids and setup 'profiles'. This is more for devices and not laptops

what we've done

- setup separate Google Accounts for each child (with a parent's gmail account in control of each of the childrens accounts)

This then lets us:

- [youtubekids.com](https://youtubekids.com) which is a curated list of videos for specific age ranges
- [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) full youtube with content filters on for appropriate age group. So kids can subscribe to fave youtubers.

Can manage all this with [https://familylink.google.com/](https://familylink.google.com/) which links to families.google.com

Henry (6) 
- he is on youtubekids. younger (5-8). 

Mia (8) 
 - is on youtubekids. older (9-12)

Both
- youtube on explore 9+
- chrome - try to block explicit sites
- google search - safe search is on

This is youtube kids -  curated bunch of videos for kids. Minecraft on here too.

Notice that the chrome browser is signed in as Mia (pizza icon), and youtubekids too. I've since unpinned the guest chrome link in the taskbar at the bottom, so only the Mia signed in Chrome profile works.

[https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) this is very addictive!



## Games Consoles

We have an old PS3 which can have many players and is good as it is in the living room.. promotes sharing, talking to each other, and I can keep an eye on what is going on.


Only 1 game matters. Minecraft!

- Creative Mode
- Survival Mode


## Amazon Alexa / Spotify 

There is a global Explicit filtering on profanity on Alexa (which filters through to Spotify).

To enable Amazon Kids on a device eg Alexa Dot, go to Settings on that device through the app on your mobile phone. Open the Alexa app . Open More and select Settings. Select Music & Podcasts, and then Profanity Filter.

- Kids Echo Dot - explicit filter (stops explicit music on Amazon Music and Spotify)
- Set Daily Time limits - sets bedtime hours so kids don't get up early and play with Alexa

We have audible books (specifically Harry Potter) which they love listening to.
