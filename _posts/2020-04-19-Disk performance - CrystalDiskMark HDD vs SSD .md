I needed reinstall Win10 on my spare laptop that I'd stolen the SSD out of and had a 10 year old hard disk sitting around.

Seriously bad idea!

It took all day to install Windows 10 and updates (compared to an hour or so I'd expect)

This got me curious as to performance differences between modern day drives and older drives.

[CrystalDiskInfo](https://crystalmark.info/en/download/) is good for the information, and [CrystalDiskMark - scroll down page](https://crystalmark.info/en/download/) gives a good rough idea of benchmark speed.

- HDD
- SSD - Solid State Drive
    - SATA - Serial ATA bus. Usually 2.5 inch same size as HDD. 9.5mm or 7mm
    - mSATA - defunct standard (wafer thin)
        - M.2 - wafer thin
        - PCI Express bus (usually) using a speed up technique called NVMe.

[Good article on Amazon about disks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ospublishing/story/e3f3d5b1-09de-4652-b163-fa9a308bad33/ref=sxin_7?pd_rd_w=PLPJM&pf_rd_p=832a297b-927a-4f4b-9373-25187b5b678b&pf_rd_r=C7PE83186DNWGFZGX8X7&pd_rd_r=0dd0fa8c-8e58-4018-a6d8-a7d911fcecb7&pd_rd_wg=woWXU&qid=1587060816&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.e3f3d5b1-09de-4652-b163-fa9a308bad33.A1F83G8C2ARO7P.en_GB&linkCode=oas&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.e3f3d5b1-09de-4652-b163-fa9a308bad33.A1F83G8C2ARO7P.en_GB&tag=pcmagukonsite00-21&cv_ct_cx=ssd)

## HDD - 10 year

From around the 2010 era of an Apple MacBook Pro.

## HDD - 8 years

Came with my XPS17 laptop (had dual ones of this drive)

## HDD - 5 years

4TB Western Digital inside a fast desktop

## SSD

Came with 3 year old Lenovo E560 laptop.

Notice it is 5 times the speed of the best HDD's I have!

## SSD - M.2 NVMe

Wow - this is insanely fast compared to my SATA SSD

## Conclusion

It makes a massive difference having a good drive in your machine! Always run your system drive from an SSD these days, and use HDDs for storage.
