I started blogging about 8 years ago with [programgood.net](http://www.programgood.net)  It turned into a very good ideas repository, not a blog.  *That's fine.*  
 
I'd now like to try a more 'walkthrough' style blog, taking inspiration from [hanselman.com](http://www.hanselman.com) and [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5) 

Like all research projects, I start with [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/), so I can share notes across all devices (2 at home, 1 at work and iPhone)

## Why Blog?
* Help others 
* Build brand as a developer so you can earn good money
* Carrot to 'finish' writing projects

## Titles
What is in it for your reader?

## Who are the target audience?

Jeff Bezos - write the press release first.

"davemateer.com blog is where to go, to find in-depth tutorial articles on high performance business applications which are maintainable"

"Dave Mateer is a professional software developer who can make *simple* *performant* and *maintainable* code"

## How to reach your (awesome) audience?

- Talk at conferences
- Answer questions on SO and link to articles
- Do code reviews are link to articles
- Pluralsight make videos
- Youtube
