I started blogging 8 years ago with [Programgood - First Post](http://www.programgood.net/2008/11/08/GoalsBackgroundOfProgramGoodNet.aspx)  It turned into a very good ideas repository, not a blog.  *That's fine.*  
 
I'd now like to try a more 'walkthrough' style blog, taking inspiration from [hanselman.com](http://www.hanselman.com) and [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5) 

Like all research projects, I start with [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/), so I can share notes across all devices (2 at home, 1 at work and iPhone)

## Why Blog?
* Helps you learn (by the act of writing down logically)
* Help others 
* Build brand as a developer so you can earn good money
* Carrot to 'finish' writing projects
* Sharpen communication through written word
* Makes you Happy! (when others read what you write and care!)
* Tell stories

## Titles
What is in it for your reader?

What are you passionate about?  It really doesn't matter how much of an 'expert' you are at a subject.  If you care enough to write on a subject, then damn, <b>get on it</b>, and write it.  More than likely, others will care about the same.

## Who are your (fabulous) target audience?

Jeff Bezos - write the press release first.

"davemateer.com blog is where to go, to find in-depth tutorial articles on high performance business applications which are maintainable"
