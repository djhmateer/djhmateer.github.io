[Reaper](https://reaper.fm) is a Digital Audio Workstation.

After years of not using one, and learning from an expert who [recorded and mastered our album - Outro by Edinburgh4](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lYPifRpiRxK32ZWqmV4l_PfNkqaVQLJl4) it is nice to play with a daw again.

Like many things I enjoy the process of writing a blog post, to help my learning.

## External Soundcard

[Behringer UM2](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0AVV) I bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EK1OTZC) for £35.

There is talk on the amazon reviews about using an older Behringer driver, but I've got asio4all working:

Behringer recommend using the [asio4all.org](https://www.asio4all.org/) driver

I'm using the 2.14 release from May 2017.

External sound card with guitar plugged into input 1. Phantom power turned off. 1/4" (6.35mm) to 3.5mm headphone converter - which is a bit loose. It cost £2.99. I've ordered another at £8 to see if that is better.

I'm running computer audio to speakers (the green 3.5mm jack going into the pc at the top front), and external soundcard audio to headphones. This is so I can listen to YouTube and use Reaper at the same side. Can't have both going through the same device.

## YouTube

[Reaper DAW 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwDcTPn2dvc) is a great tutorial.

He covers initially the setting up of the external sound card.

For my setup I've got the ASIO buffer size down to 256 samples giving me 11ms/11ms latency. Apparently this is about right with USB. A faster bus like PCI can get closer to 7ms.

Interestingly on the YouTube video he was getting 8/5ms which is good. The interface looked more expensive.


## Guitar Tuner

VST ReaTune (Cockos)

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/tune.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/tune.jpg)

Handy guitar tuner which comes included with Reaper.

## VSTs

[izotope Trash 2 distortion plugin](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/downloads/trash.html) free for December 2021

[waves](https://www.waves.com/downloads/free) have some good ones too

## Click Track

Onto a new track

Insert, Click Source 

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/click.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/click.jpg)

25s of click track, at 96bpm

Notice the gat track is armed, so I can live monitor the sound through headphones.

## Creating New Projects

Very handy when creating a new project, can move the existing assets (as you don't need a project name to start with) to the new directory.
