[Reaper](https://reaper.fm) is a [Digital Audio Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation). I'm using 6.43 fro 21st December 2021.

I learned about daw's years ago from an expert who [recorded and mastered our album - Outro by Edinburgh4](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lYPifRpiRxK32ZWqmV4l_PfNkqaVQLJl4)

Like many things I enjoy the process of writing a blog post to help my learning.

## External Soundcard

[Behringer UM2](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0AVV) I bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EK1OTZC) for £35.

There is talk on the amazon reviews about using an older Behringer driver, but I've got asio4all working:

Behringer recommend using the [asio4all.org](https://www.asio4all.org/) driver

I'm using the 2.14 release from May 2017.

External sound card with guitar plugged into input 1. Phantom power turned off. 1/4" (6.35mm) to 3.5mm headphone converter - which is a bit loose. It cost £2.99. I've ordered another at £8 to see if that is better.

I'm running computer audio to speakers (the green 3.5mm jack going into the pc at the top front), and external soundcard audio to headphones. This is so I can listen to YouTube and use Reaper at the same side. Can't have both going through the same device.

## YouTube

[Reaper DAW 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwDcTPn2dvc) is a great tutorial.

He covers initially the setting up of the external sound card.

For my setup I've got the ASIO buffer size down to 256 samples giving me 11ms/11ms latency. Apparently this is about right with USB. A faster bus like PCI can get closer to 7ms.

Interestingly on the YouTube video he was down to buffer size of 128 samples giving 5ms/4.5ms which is good. The interface looked more expensive.
 
## foo

`space` - start stop

`Ctrl r` - record

`r` - repeat toggle

highlight a selection on track screen

`escape` - get rid of selection

`+ -` or mouse wheel - zoom tracks in out. 

`Ctrl m` - mixer

## Live monitor

Lets you hear from your audio out what is happening in real time, including any latency. 

I'm working on a laptop without my external sourdcard now, and you can see the massive latency with my built in microphone. With live monitor there is some great delay.

Live monitor has moved to the mixer

## Save all on stop

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/stop.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/stop.jpg)

untick check box so it saves automatically each time you record

## Inserts Effect (FX)

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/fx.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/fx.jpg)

Drag the line to see the inserts/fx and sends. 

All the sound in a channel goes through every Inserts Effect

[VST's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) - audio plugin format from Steinberg.

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/tune.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/tune.jpg)

ReaComp - Reapers own compressor

ReaEq

ReaVerbate - reverb

 YT guy recommends [https://slatedigital.com/](https://slatedigital.com/) everything bundle

[izotope Trash 2 distortion plugin](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/downloads/trash.html) free for December 2021

[waves](https://www.waves.com/downloads/free) have some good ones too

JS - Reaper own format

## Sends

Sending sound out to a separate track eg for reverb can send many tracks to that same reverb

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/reverb.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/reverb.jpg)

Turn down dry - the original signal

Add a send on the vox track to THE REVERB

Can send only a certain amount to the reverb



## Guitar Tuner

VST ReaTune (Cockos)


Handy guitar tuner which comes included with Reaper.

## Click Track

Onto a new track

Insert, Click Source 

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/click.jpg "email")](/assets/2021-12-21/click.jpg)

25s of click track, at 96bpm

Notice the gat track is armed, so I can live monitor the sound through headphones.


## Creating New Projects

[![alt text](/assets/2021-12-21/dave.jpg "email"){:width="700px"}](/assets/2021-12-21/dave.jpg)

Very handy when creating a new project, can move the existing assets (as you don't need a project name to start with) to the new directory.
