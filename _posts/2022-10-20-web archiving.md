## What is Web Archiving

Keeping copies of a web page / site.

[https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/) aka The Wayback Machine is the most well know web archiver.

## When is web archving used?

[https://specs.webrecorder.net/use-cases/0.1.0/#researcher-saves-an-article](https://specs.webrecorder.net/use-cases/0.1.0/#researcher-saves-an-article) - use cases

My specific use cases are

- for Human Rights Investigators who need to archive social media images / videos for later use to prove what has happened.
- journalists who need to archive images/video to make sure they can use them in their stories (ie may disappear in a few days)


## Formats

Web archive formats

- WARC [Web ARChive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) .warc, .warc.gz - Supported - the standard to follow.
