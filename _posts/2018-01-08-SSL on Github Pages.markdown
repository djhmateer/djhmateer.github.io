### Summary
Using SSL on a blog site is important as it can give you better SEO


### DDD12
A big thanks to everyone who came along to my talk at [DDD12](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/Schedule). It was great to have a lot of questions and discussion after the talk.

### Sample Code
Here is the code I used in the presentation (without the Twitter keys)

[VerySimpleTwitterClient](https://github.com/djhmateer/VerySimpleTwitterClient)

This next repo is where I do the fast 25,000tweets/second going into SQLServer. This is a good starting point to check out the technologies. Get in touch if you'd like me to write some blog posts / make a video on how to do this.
