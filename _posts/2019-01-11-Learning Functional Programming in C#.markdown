Here is the 3 month journey so far in exploring Functional Programming in C# and the resources I've found most useful:

## Why learn FP techniques
[NDC Video by Enrico Buonanno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJq86IXkFdQ)  

- Power (do more with less code, raise the level of abstraction)
- Safety (avoiding unnecessary side effects makes code easier to reason about)
- Clarity 

And

- Has pushed my C# language skills 
- Is fun!

## Favourite Resources 

 ### Pluralsight    
  [K Scott Allen - Linq Fundamentals with C#6 Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linq-fundamentals-csharp-6/table-of-contents)

- Extension methods
- Select
- Where
- OrderBy
- Any
- All
- Take
- Lambda expressions

### Resharper

Using [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) to understand the names of different concepts and different ways of writing something  

### Euler
Did some Euler problems in a functional way ie use Linq as much as possible
- [Project Euler FP](/2018/09/20/Improve-Programming-using-Project-Euler)   
[Repository of Imperative and Functional Approaches for first 17 or so](https://davemateer.visualstudio.com/_git/Euler1)  

### C# Language Skills

### Book
![ps](/assets/2019-01-11/2.png)  
[Functional Programming in C# book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp) is a very in depth book.
