I love the excitment of being an entrepreneur. Big highs (a sale) and big lows when customers complain or they don't want to pay for something.

A piece of advice I once read was that it is good to follow ideas where the *people you work with* are people you like to be surrounded by.

For example I've working in the field of Human Rights for about 4 years, and have met some of the kindest people.

So let's explore how to help people in this area, and how to make money (so I can feed my family and ultimately make sure they have great opportunities in life). No pressure!


## 1. Write down

```text
please help me as an entrepreneur brainstorm and refine business ideas in the area of human rights. Provide thoughtful advice, ask probing questions, and challenge me to think critically about growth strategies. while being supportive, please push me to consider why I am not growing at the pace I desire and help me find shortcomings in the approach. please also consider work life balance as I've got a young family, and love working from home. I probably work 5 hours per day. I run my own company as a 1 person startup.

I've had projects in human rights https://osr4rightstools.org/ where I built this website and backend infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. It provided 4 different open source tools for human rights investigators. It was a venture with Swansea University and funded by ESRC.

This above project spun out an idea https://auto-archiver.com/ which is successful and has 2 major clients using these services. I ended up contributing back to this open source project which was started by https://www.bellingcat.com/. Finding other clients has proven to be difficult as I belive the product market fit isn't strong.

It also spun out another law project https://arlawesi.org.uk/ with Swansea Univeristy where I helped the team devliver a project very quickly.

I've done lots of consulting (not on a day rate but on a project rate) around: building reporting systems, building portals for companies, integration with Twitter API, migrating domains using Google, analysing Facebook data.

I enjoy writing software in C#, Python, PHP, SQL Server, Functional programming, HTML, CSS and have a lot of experience in infrastructure as well eg Azure, Proxmox, Linux servers, Bash.

My technical blog is on https://davemateer.com/

LLM's can help, by being a sounding board, and behave like a business coach / MBA (as it has been trained on data like this). I use [ChatGPT-4]() and [Claude]() and [Bard]()
