Idea Validation so that...

> Find a small group of people and make them amazingly happy and you will make money.

Great... but show me a repeatable process of how to narrow down on markets which I may find a niche (and be happy and make money.

Practise is everything... always keep shipping... and fail fast! Then do again.

These are all great pieces of advice.. but the subtext is much harder.. about marketing too and getting good at that. So perhaps ship, market, fail fast!


I find this to be one of the hardest parts of bootstrapping or entrepreneurism. There is so much to think about it becomes overwhelming, and the default is to fall into the trap of doing something comfortable such as programming up a proof of concept. 

Common mistakes developer bootstrapper entrepreneurs make (and I've done all of these)

- Starting with our own list of 'product ideas' (this isn't necessarly bad, but its about our customers not us)
- Just start to code up a proof of concepts without any forethought for market, marketing, product market fit
- Reading all the books and getting disheartened
- Writing blog articles and not following though (writing methods really helps me though to condense my thinking)
- Taking time to do markets, marketing

To make you all feel better (and for my future self) I've started writing many blog articles since June 2019. 3 years of research, 1 proof of concept (yes I spent many months perhaps a year on this as a hobby project) where I eventually didn't really launch it. It's not all in vain as

Becoming a student of a subject, reading books, talking to others is all an important journey. For me it is as enjoying as learning an new programming language eg [Haskell](), [F#](), [Python]() or implementing new infrastructure eg [Proxmox](), [Azure CLI](), [Building machines]().

## Blogging

As of 9th June 2022 I've got around 125 unpublished blog articles. This is crazy! But I'm not worried as I like writing, and the focus at the moment is on evaluating a niche for making money. 

Writing blog articles is cathartic, cements knowledge, is a wondering resource to look back on, and is my way of becoming calm about a subject which is overpowering.

Like Making Money.

## asdf

Like programming I endeavour to learn from the best, and not make the mistakes everyone else has made. I am making those mistakes, but perhaps recovering more quickly as I realise that signs such as:

- Don't build a POC and assume your customers will just come!
- Get out of the building (and talk to customers)
- Look after customers
- Be customer driven
- Do research but get on with it asap
- Just Ship It

# Values

[https://hotjar.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REC/pages/269942884/Hotjar+Core+Values](https://hotjar.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REC/pages/269942884/Hotjar+Core+Values) inspired from hotjar

1.Put our customers at the heart of everything
2.Be bold and move fast
3.Work with respect
4.Build trust with transparency
5.Challenge ourselves to grow

# Find Niches / Ideas

So now we have a way to write and be transparent (blogging / writing), where should we start?

From [Rob's book]():

look at all people you know, then their work experience or hobby
then talk to them.. what pains you in this
then could this be solved with software?

From [Jason's Cohoen Vide]()

He got out there are contacted 40 people

From [Pieters book]() Chapter 2

- Solve your own problems
- Start from the problem not the solution
- Start small


From [Shails book]():

- If I talk who listens
- Where and with whomn do I already spend my time online and offline
- When am I most myself
- who do I hang out with 

then
 contribute ie help people

So now we have a top x bunch of niches

## Evaluate a niche

Is this a smart niche to be in?

- Describe value (ie what problems does it solve)
- For whom
- How easy is it to get in touch with these people?


## Doing

market, marketing, aesthetic, product

After choosing a niche and taking a leap, lets look at our values and be transparent

- Put customers at heart of everything ie make sure email list (launch list) is setup and we're regularly communicating and listening
- Write blog articles about how we're doing this
- Tweet?


## Landing Page

eg [https://www.typeform.com/](https://www.typeform.com/) is what Pieter Levels used.

With an email sign up

Launch list - ideal to have many.. eg many 1000

Go and speak at conferences, etc ... get people excited and signed up!


## Other Tools

[https://workflowy.com/](https://workflowy.com/) allows lists to be edited by many people. He used it to allow people to give him feedback on chapters (after they had paid for access)

[Google docs]() to write in public

[Twitch]() live stream writing process.

Every time he finished a chapter he sent it out to all pre-order customers. And they could review it again in google docs.
