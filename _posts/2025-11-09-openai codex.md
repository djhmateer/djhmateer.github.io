There is a cli

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex

codex
```

And there is a VS Code Extension [Quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart)

There doesn't seem to be a highlight of code so I can explain it?

Yes there is - just hightlight and it works with Auto Context.  Only in the VS Code extension view.
