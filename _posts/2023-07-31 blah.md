work on montage stuff for imovie!

1130 leave for skateboarding

spreadsheet for england party
people for scotland party?

remember to merge conflict stuff!

- system preferences, mouse, reverse wheel direction
- system preferences, keyboard, map caps lock to escape (check both keyboards!)

- to enable keyboard repeating (Which I use in vim to move left and right)

```bash
# then reboot to get auto keyboard repeat
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

- to get hash symbol Alt-3

brew problem not supported anymore
 eg installing wget taking ages
  vim taking ages


## imovie

import to project media (rather than global iMovie library)

\ - play from beginning

## photos

ken burns effect - panning / zoom
 imovie preferences

make it small (use rectangle) to decrease size to start and end

## titles

use different fonts to make it look like not imovie

place cursor
q - add conneted media
 
## editing

stabilisation - set to low eg 12%.. well lit

## audio

whilst most people will forgive bad video
most will not forgive bad audio

eg hype mic by apogee sounds just fine

voiceover can do

## base correction

- cmd c
- cmd option v - paste all attributes

## export

- file, share, File
Quality should be `high` and not ``
