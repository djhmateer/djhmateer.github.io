After 4 months of doing a code club at my local primary school we've learned lots


Year 4's we got 4 who are really into it and have come along massively

## Scratch MIT is good

setup accounts (free) for all students eg we've used xyzcc (coding club) 1.. 

- xyzcc1
- xyzcc2

and the same password. The children remember their number and password, and can login from home.


Especially the [tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)

## 1. Getting Started

[Getting Started](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) tutorial - notice the video in the window. Press the white/green arrow which shows you slides of what to do.

`Blocks` used on a `Sprite`. Right click to add a `Comment` where I've labelled which the `type` of the block ie where to find it in the menu. The colours should help too.

## 2. Animate a Name

You can print stuff off (which I'm sure is very helpful). We just let the children do the tutorials with the video or slides

When a sprite is clicked, play a sound

When sprit is clicked, change colour (the A)
