After 4 months of doing a code club at my local primary school we've learned lots


Year 4's we got 4 who are really into it and have come along massively

## Scratch MIT is good

setup accounts (free) for all students eg we've used xyzcc (coding club) 1.. 

- xyzcc1
- xyzcc2

and the same password. The children remember their number and password, and can login from home.


Especially the [tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)

## 1. Getting Started

[![alt text](/assets/2023-07-06/1.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-07-06/1.jpg)

[Getting Started](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) tutorial - notice the video in the window. Press the white/green arrow which shows you slides of what to do.

`Blocks` used on a `Sprite`. Right click to add a `Comment` where I've labelled which the `type` of the block ie where to find it in the menu. The colours should help too.

## 2. Animate a Name

[tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/872470361/editor)

You can print stuff off (which I'm sure is very helpful). We just let the children do the tutorials with the video or slides

When a sprite is clicked, play a sound

When sprit is clicked, change colour (the A)

Turning a sprite (the V)

Own demo of first things learned including figuring out how to reset the sprite direction of program restart.


## 3. Imagine a World

[![alt text](/assets/2023-07-06/9.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-07-06/9.jpg)

New things learned here:

- switch backdrop
- go to x y coords (on green flag ie reset)
- glide to position

- switch costume
- set size to 125% (rather than making size bigger by 10 on repeat)
- arrow keys move sprite

- glide to random position

## B. Dog on Moon

## 4. Make Music

Interesting as can make chords

[![alt text](/assets/2023-07-06/11.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-07-06/11.jpg)

- operator - pick random 1 to 10!
- next costume to give note graphic from sax

## 5. Story

[![alt text](/assets/2023-07-06/12.jpg "email")](/assets/2023-07-06/12.jpg)

- witchhouse background
