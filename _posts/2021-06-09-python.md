I'm working with academic data scientists who write in [Python](https://www.python.org/). I use C# mainly.


So here is my beginners guide to Python 


## What is Python

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) 

- Interpreted (ie no compilation to bytecode or machine code). The python interpreter directly executes instructions.
- Dynamically typed, but Strongly typed eg forbidding adding a number to a string.
- Garbage collected
- Structured (particularly procedural), OO and Functional
- Has comprehensive standard library
- Consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages
- no { } - it uses whitespace. Recommended is 4 spaces.

## What is Python2 vs Python3

Python3 is not backwards compatible with Python 2.

Python2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

## Installing Python 

Most versions of Ubuntu 20.04 come with python3 pre-installed.

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) latest is 3.9.5 on 9th Jun 2021.

```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04 on WSL2 is Python 2.7.17
python --version

# Ubuntu 18.04 on WSL2 is Python 3.6.9
python3 --version

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

## Ubuntu 20.04 on Azure giving 3.8.5 on 9th June 2021
python3 --version

## Windows 10 - can't find a default python
## 3.9.5 after install on 9th June 2021
py --version
```

To get the latest version on my Ubuntu 18 WSL I used [https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu):

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41986507/unable-to-set-default-python-version-to-python3-in-ubuntu](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41986507/unable-to-set-default-python-version-to-python3-in-ubuntu) discusses default versions and how to take priority. Seems it is fine to have multiple versions around (and don't remove)

Possibly don't 

```bash
# was there already
sudo apt install software-properties-common

# see the python and snake reference here!
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

sudo apt install python3.9

# it didn't work! still said 3.6.9
python3 --version

# ahha it says 3.9.5
python3.9 --version

sudo apt remove python3
sudo apt remove python3.9

# hmm python 3.9 was still there after this
sudo apt-get remove --purge python3.9

# ahha this got rid of it
sudo apt autoremove

# this gets the right version, but have to type python3.9 to run it
sudo apt-get install python3.9

# alias - maybe don't do this
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/320996/how-to-make-python-program-command-execute-python-3
# alias python=python3.9
```

## Pip

Pip is a tool for installing Python packages from PyPI - Python Package Index. Analogous to CPAN for Perl.

PyPI primarily hosts Python packages in the form of archives called sdists or precompiled wheels.

When installing Python modules globally it is recommended to use apt.

Use pip to install a module globally only if there is no deb package for this module.

Prefer using pip within a virtual environment only. Python virtual environments allow you to install python modules in an isolated location for a specific project.

Seems tricky.. [https://askubuntu.com/questions/431780/apt-get-install-vs-pip-install](https://askubuntu.com/questions/431780/apt-get-install-vs-pip-install)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip

# 21.0.1 from python 3.6
# ahh where did 3.6.9 come back from?
# don't use sudo on pip3
pip3 --version

pip3 install scrapy
# a specific version
pip3 install scrapy==1.5

#replace pip3 with pip2 if using python2

# shows installed packages
# and showed me I was using an outdated version of python
pip3 list

# put on 21.1.2
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

```
## Getting a script working - ffhq-dataset downloader

`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'` - googling around says I have to install the module. I'm favouring apt instead of pip3.

```bash
# need pip
sudo apt install python3-pip

## didn't work
sudo apt-get install python-requests

## didn't work
pip3 install requests

## ahha - it somehow has installed in my python 3.6 installation.. gosh
# gets further now
python3 download_ffhq.py 
```

`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` - so lets use pip3 to get them all (should favour apt)

```bash
pip3 install image
pip3 install scipy

python3 download_ffhq.py

## google drive download quota exceeded
## hmm maybe not.
python3 download_ffhq.py --json
```

So then I had to follow [PR #3](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset/pull/3)

```bash
pip3 install pydrive2

```

Then need a client_secrets.json file


## Virtual Environments

[https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/)

## Typing

From 3.5 there is gradual typing.

CPython - interpreter and compiler as it compiles Python to bytecode before interpreting.

## VSCode

Python extension for >= 3.6
View, Command Pallete, Select the correct interpreter (I have 2.7.17 and 3.6.9)


## Code

[https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-python-beginners/table-of-contents](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-python-beginners/table-of-contents) Practical Python for Beginners by Sarah Holderness.



```python

# Python assumes the type of the variable based on the assigned value

# int
length = 10

# float
foo = 10.50

width = 20
area = length * width

```
