I'm working with some academic data scientists who write in [Python](https://www.python.org/)

We are all working with [OSR4Rights](https://osr4rights.org/) to develop tools to help human rights investigators.

## What is Python2 vs Python3

Python3 is not backwards compatible with Python 2.

Python2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

## Installing Python 

Most versions of Ubuntu 20.04 come with python3 pre-installed.

```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04 on WSL2 is Python 2.7.17
python --version

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

## Ubuntu 20.04 on Azure giving 3.8.5 on 9th June 2021
python3 --version
```
