I'm exploring LLM's and also teaching at a coding club. Can LLM's help?

## Capital City Game

> make a game in python where  it gives you the name of a country in Europe, and you are give 4 capital cities to choose from. you can then enter a guess and the program tells you if you 're right. for example it may say: France, and give 4 cities as a multiple choice: London, Paris, Rome and Berlin

By describing in English up front what we want, it is a great way to think about programmming.

###  GPT-3.5

```py
import random

# Dictionary mapping European countries to their capital cities
european_countries = {
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Italy": "Rome",
    "United Kingdom": "London",
    # Add more countries and capitals as needed
}

def choose_random_country():
    # Select a random country from the dictionary
    country = random.choice(list(european_countries.keys()))
    return country

def generate_options(correct_option):
    # Generate a list of 4 options, including the correct one
    options = [correct_option]

    # Add three random capital cities as incorrect options
    while len(options) < 4:
        random_option = random.choice(list(european_countries.values()))
        if random_option not in options:
            options.append(random_option)

    # Shuffle the options to mix up the order
    random.shuffle(options)
    return options

def main():
    print("Welcome to the European Capital Quiz!")
    
    while True:
        # Choose a random country and its correct capital
        country = choose_random_country()
        correct_capital = european_countries[country]

        # Generate multiple-choice options
        options = generate_options(correct_capital)

        print(f"What is the capital city of {country}?")
        for i, option in enumerate(options):
            print(f"{i+1}. {option}")

        try:
            # Get user's guess
            user_guess = int(input("Enter the number of your guess (1-4): "))
            
            if 1 <= user_guess <= 4:
                user_guess = options[user_guess - 1]

                # Check if the guess is correct
                if user_guess == correct_capital:
                    print("Correct! Well done!")
                else:
                    print(f"Sorry, that's incorrect. The correct answer is {correct_capital}.")
            else:
                print("Please enter a valid number (1-4).")
            
            play_again = input("Play again? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
            if play_again != 'yes':
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number (1-4).")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Well this is brilliant as it gives a good start!

>  Put in all the counties and capitals please

```py
european_countries = {
    "Albania": "Tirana",
    "Andorra": "Andorra la Vella",
    "Austria": "Vienna",
    "Belarus": "Minsk",
    "Belgium": "Brussels",
    "Bosnia and Herzegovina": "Sarajevo",
    "Bulgaria": "Sofia",
    "Croatia": "Zagreb",
    "Cyprus": "Nicosia",
    "Czech Republic": "Prague",
    "Denmark": "Copenhagen",
    "Estonia": "Tallinn",
    "Finland": "Helsinki",
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Greece": "Athens",
    "Hungary": "Budapest",
    "Iceland": "Reykjavik",
    "Ireland": "Dublin",
    "Italy": "Rome",
    "Latvia": "Riga",
    "Liechtenstein": "Vaduz",
    "Lithuania": "Vilnius",
    "Luxembourg": "Luxembourg City",
    "Malta": "Valletta",
    "Moldova": "Chisinau",
    "Monaco": "Monaco",
    "Montenegro": "Podgorica",
    "Netherlands": "Amsterdam",
    "North Macedonia": "Skopje",
    "Norway": "Oslo",
    "Poland": "Warsaw",
    "Portugal": "Lisbon",
    "Romania": "Bucharest",
    "Russia": "Moscow",
    "San Marino": "San Marino",
    "Serbia": "Belgrade",
    "Slovakia": "Bratislava",
    "Slovenia": "Ljubljana",
    "Spain": "Madrid",
    "Sweden": "Stockholm",
    "Switzerland": "Bern",
    "Ukraine": "Kyiv",
    "United Kingdom": "London",
    "Vatican City": "Vatican City",
}
```

Notice that we need to check facts eg UK: London. I'd split that into the 4 separate countries.

> Can you make a high score counter?


### Bard

Bard produces 3 differnt drafts of the answer. Here is #1 (simple versin). 

```py
import random

# create a dictionary of European countries and their capitals
countries = {
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Italy": "Rome",
    "Spain": "Madrid",
    "United Kingdom": "London",
    "Poland": "Warsaw",
    "Ukraine": "Kyiv",
    "Romania": "Bucharest",
    "Netherlands": "Amsterdam",
    "Belgium": "Brussels",
    "Czech Republic": "Prague",
    "Greece": "Athens"
}

# get a random country from the dictionary
country = random.choice(list(countries.keys()))

# get the capital of the selected country
capital = countries[country]

# generate 3 random wrong answers
wrong_answers = []
for i in range(3):
    wrong_answer = random.choice(list(countries.values()))
    while wrong_answer == capital or wrong_answer in wrong_answers:
        wrong_answer = random.choice(list(countries.values()))
    wrong_answers.append(wrong_answer)

# shuffle the answers
answers = [capital] + wrong_answers
random.shuffle(answers)

# print the question and answers
print("What is the capital of {}?".format(country))
for i in range(4):
    print("{}. {}".format(i + 1, answers[i]))

# get the user's guess
guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))

# check the user's guess
if guess == 1 and answers[0] == capital:
    print("Correct!")
elif guess == 2 and answers[1] == capital:
    print("Correct!")
elif guess == 3 and answers[2] == capital:
    print("Correct!")
elif guess == 4 and answers[3] == capital:
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print("Incorrect. The correct answer is {}".format(capital))

```

#2 includes some of suggestions it made for #1!!! wow this is super. This one includesa high score counter:

```py
import random

def generate_question():
  """Generates a question for the game.

  Returns:
    A tuple of (country, capital, options), where country is the name of the
    European country, capital is the correct answer, and options is a list of
    four possible answers, including the correct answer.
  """

  countries = ["France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "United Kingdom"]
  capitals = ["Paris", "Berlin", "Rome", "Madrid", "London"]

  country = random.choice(countries)
  capital = capitals[countries.index(country)]
  options = random.sample(capitals, 4)
  options[options.index(capital)] = capital

  return country, capital, options

def main():
  """Plays the game."""

  score = 0

  while True:
    country, capital, options = generate_question()

    print(f"What is the capital of {country}?")
    print("Options:", options)

    guess = input("Your guess: ")

    if guess == capital:
      print("Correct!")
      score += 1
    else:
      print("Incorrect. The correct answer is", capital)

    print(f"Your score is {score}")

    play_again = input("Play again? (y/n) ")
    if play_again != "y":
      break

  print(f"Thanks for playing! Your final score is {score}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

```
This one you have to type the answer eg London ... nice

#3 is actually broken and doesn't produce the correct results!!!
