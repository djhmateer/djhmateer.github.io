Life is to be enjoyed

I've spent a lot of time learning about the beauty of back end code

I do appreciate front end styling, but have never put time into it until now.


So lets just do something.

Art purely for fun!


## A Splash Screen

[https://remix.run/](https://remix.run/) looks very exciting as a product, and I was impressed by their splash screen.

So lets learn how to make something in this style.

## Colors

[Chrome color picker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en) seemed good.

So it gets pretty complex using Tailwind - I'm aiming to build simplicity.

Background Color: #121212
White Text: #FFFFFF
Blue v1.0 Text: #3992FF
Yellow open text: #FECC1B

Used the color picker to easily get hex color codes.

The light grey text was a bit tricky to see, so using Chrome Dev Tools (and I can see they are using TailwindCSS from here):

light gray: #B7BCBE - rgb(183, 188, 190)
